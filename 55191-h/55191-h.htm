<h2 class="p4">PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="p2">The present work is designed to meet the want, which has long been
felt, of a descriptive account of the Birds of North America, with
notices of their geographical distribution, habits, methods of
nesting, character of eggs, their popular nomenclature, and other
points connected with their life history.</p>

<p>For many years past the only systematic treatises bearing upon this
subject have been “The American Ornithology” of Alexander Wilson,
finished by that author in 1814, and brought down to the date of 1827
by George Ord; the “Ornithological Biography” of Audubon, bearing date
of 1838, with a second edition, “Birds of America,” embracing a little
more of detail, and completed in 1844; and “A Manual of the
Ornithology of the United States and Canada,” by Nuttall, of which a
first edition was published in 1832 and a second in 1840. Since then
no work relating to American Ornithology, of a biographical nature,
has been presented to the public, with the exception of some of
limited extent, such as those of Giraud, on the “Birds of Long
Island,” in 1844; De Kay’s “Birds of New York,” 1844; Samuels’s
“Ornithology and Oölogy of New England,” 1868, and a few others;
together with quite a number of minor papers on the birds of
particular localities, of greater or less moment, chiefly published in
periodicals and the Proceedings of Societies. The reports of many of
the government exploring parties also contain valuable data,
especially those of Dr. Newberry, Dr. Heermann, Dr. J. G. Cooper, Dr.
Suckley, Dr. Kennerly, and others.</p>

<p>More recently (in 1870) Professor Whitney, Chief of the Geological
Survey of California, has published a very important volume on the
ornithology of the entire west coast of North America, written by Dr.
J. G. Cooper, and containing much original detail in reference to the
habits of the western species. This is by far the most valuable
contribution to the biography of American birds that has appeared
since the time of Audubon, and, with its typographical beauty and
numerous and excellent illustrations, all on wood and many of them
colored, constitutes one of the most noteworthy publications in
American Zoölogy.</p>

<p>Up to the time of the appearance of the work of Audubon, nearly all
that was known of the great region of the United States west of the
Missouri River was the result of the journey of Lewis and Clark up the
Missouri and
<!--005.png--><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg vi]</span>
across to the Pacific Coast, and that of John K. Townsend
and Mr. Nuttall, both of whom made some collections and brought back
notices of the country, which, however, they were unable to explore to
any great extent. The entire region of Texas, New Mexico, Colorado,
Arizona, Nevada, and California was unvisited, as also a great portion
of territory north of the United States boundary, including British
Columbia and Alaska.</p>

<p>A work by Sir John Richardson, forming a volume in his series of
“Fauna Boreali-Americana,” in reference to the ornithology of the
region covered by the Hudson Bay Company’s operations, was published
in 1831, and has been much used by Mr. Audubon, but embraces little or
nothing of the great breeding-grounds of the water birds in the
neighborhood of the Great Slave and Bear Lakes, the Upper Yukon, and
the shores of the Arctic coast.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that a third of a century has elapsed since any
attempt has been made to present a systematic history of the birds of
North America.</p>

<p>The object of the present work is to give, in as concise a form as
possible, an account of what is known of the birds, not only of the
United States, but of the whole region of North America north of the
boundary-line of Mexico, including Greenland, on the one side, and
Alaska with its islands on the other. The published materials for such
a history are so copious that it is a matter of surprise that they
have not been sooner utilized, consisting, as they do, of numerous
scattered biographies and reports of many government expeditions and
private explorations. But the most productive source has been the
great amount of manuscript contained in the archives of the
Smithsonian Institution in the form of correspondence, elaborate
reports, and the fieldnotes of collectors and travellers, the use of
which, for the present work, has been liberally allowed by Professor
Henry. By far the most important of these consist of notes made by the
late Robert Kennicott in British America, and received from him and
other gentlemen in the Hudson Bay Territory, who were brought into
intimate relationship with the Smithsonian Institution through Mr.
Kennicott’s efforts. Among them may be mentioned more especially Mr.
R. MacFarlane, Mr. B. R. Ross, Mr. James Lockhart, Mr. Lawrence Clark,
Mr. Strachan Jones, and others, whose names will appear in the course
of the work. The especial value of the communications received from
these gentlemen lies in the fact that they resided for a long time in
a region to which a large proportion of the rapacious and water birds
of North America resort during the summer for incubation, and which
until recently has been sealed to explorers.</p>

<p>Equally serviceable has been the information received from the region
of the Yukon River and Alaska generally, including the Aleutian
Islands, as supplied by Messrs. Robert Kennicott, William H. Dall,
Henry M. Bannister, Henry W. Elliott, and others.</p>

<p>It should be understood that the remarks as to the absence of general
works on American Ornithology, since the time of Audubon, apply only
to the life
<!--006.png--><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg vii]</span>
history of the species, as, in 1858, one of the authors
of the present work published a systematic account of the birds of
North America, constituting <abbr title="volume nine">Vol. IX.</abbr> of the series of Pacific Railroad
Reports; while from the pen of Dr. Elliott Coues, a well-known and
eminent ornithologist, appeared in 1872 a comprehensive volume,
entitled “A Key to North American Birds,” containing descriptions of
the species and higher groups.</p>

<p>The technical, or descriptive, matter of the present work has been
prepared by Messrs. Baird and Ridgway, that relating to the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Raptores</i> entirely by Mr. Ridgway; and all the accounts of the
habits of the species are from the pen of Dr. Brewer. In addition to
the matter supplied by these gentlemen, Professor Theodore N. Gill has
furnished that portion of the Introduction defining the class of birds
as compared with the other vertebrates; while to Dr. Coues is to be
given the entire credit for the pages embracing the tables of the
Orders and Families, as well as for the Glossary beginning on page 535
of <abbr title="volume three">Vol. III</abbr>.</p>

<p>Nearly all the drawings of the full-length figures of birds contained
in the work were made directly on the wood, by Mr. Edwin L. Sheppard,
of Philadelphia, from original sketches taken from nature; while the
heads were executed for the most part by Mr. Henry W. Elliott and Mr.
Ridgway. Both series have been engraved by Mr. Hobart H. Nichols of
Washington. The generic outlines were drawn by Anton L. Schönborn, and
engraved by the peculiar process of Jewett, Chandler, &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, of
Buffalo. All of these, it is believed, speak for themselves, and
require no other commendation.</p>

<p>A considerable portion of the illustrations were prepared, by the
persons mentioned above, for the Reports of the Geological Survey of
California, and published in the volume on Ornithology. To Professor
Whitney, Chief of the Survey, acknowledgments are due for the
privilege of including many of them in the present History of North
American Birds, and also for the Explanation of Terms, page 526 of
<abbr title="volume three">Vol. III</abbr>.</p>

<p>A few cuts, drawn by Wolf and engraved by Whymper, first published in
“British Birds in their Haunts,” and credited in their proper places,
were kindly furnished by the London Society for the Diffusion of
Christian Knowledge; and some others prepared for an unpublished
volume by Dr. Blasius, on the Birds of Germany, were obtained from
Messrs. Vieweg and Son, of Braunschweig.</p>

<p>The volume on the Water Birds is in an advanced state of preparation,
and will be published with the least possible delay.</p>

<h2 class="p4">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>The class of Birds (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aves</i>), as represented in the present age of the
world, is composed of very many species, closely related among
themselves and distinguished by numerous characters common to all. For
the purposes of the present work it is hardly necessary to attempt the
definition of what constitutes a bird, the veriest tyro being able to
decide as to the fact in regard to any North American animal.
Nevertheless, for the sake of greater completeness, we may say that,
compared with other classes,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> Birds are abranchiate vertebrates,
with a brain filling the cranial cavity, the cerebral portion of which
is moderately well developed, the corpora striata connected by a small
anterior commissure (no corpus callosum developed), prosencephalic
hemispheres large, the optic lobes lateral, the cerebellum
transversely multifissured; the lungs and heart not separated by a
diaphragm from the abdominal viscera; aortic arch single (the right
only being developed); blood, with nucleated red corpuscles,
undergoing a complete circulation, being received and transmitted by
the right half of the quadrilocular heart to the lungs for aeration
(and thus warmed), and afterwards returned by the other half through
the system (there being no communication between the arterial and
venous portions); skull with a single median convex condyle, chiefly
on the basi-occipital (with the sutures for the most part early
obliterated); the lower jaw with its rami ossifying from several
points, connected with the skull by the intervention of a quadrate
bone (homologous with the malleus); pelvis with ilia prolonged in
front of the acetabulum, ischia and pubes nearly parallel with each
other, and the ischia usually separated: anterior and posterior
members much differentiated; the former modified for flight, with the
humerus nearly parallel with the axis of the body and concealed in the
muscles, the radius and ulna distinct, with two persistent carpal
bones, and two to four digits; the legs with the bones peculiarly
combined, (1) the proximal tarsal bones coalescing with the adjoining
tibia, and (2) the distal tarsal coalescing with three (second, third,
and fourth) metatarsals (the first metatarsal being free), and forming
the so-called tarsometatarsus; dermal appendages developed as
feathers: oviparous, the eggs being fertilized within the body,
excluded with an oval, calcareous shell, and
<!--011.png--><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg xii]</span>
hatched at a temperature
of about 104<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> F. (generally by the incubation upon them of the
mother).<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Such are some of the features common to all the existing species of
birds.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> Many others might be enumerated, but only those are given
which contrast with the characteristics of the mammals on the one hand
and those of the reptiles on the other. The inferior vertebrates are
distinguished by so many salient characters and are so widely
separated from the higher that they need not be compared with the
present class.</p>

<p>Although birds are of course readily recognizable by the observer, and
are definable at once, existing under present conditions, as
warm-blooded vertebrates, with the anterior members primitively
adapted for flight,&mdash;they are sometimes abortive,&mdash;and covered with
feathers, such characteristics do not suffice to enable us to
appreciate the relations of the class. The characteristics have been
given more fully in order to permit a comparison between the members
of the class and those of the mammals and reptiles. The class is
without exception the most homogeneous in the animal kingdom; and
among the living forms less differences are observable than between
the representatives of many natural orders among other classes. But
still the differences between them and the other existing forms are
sufficient, perhaps, to authorize the distinction of the group as a
class, and such rank has always been allowed excepting by one recent
naturalist.</p>

<p>But if we further compare the characters of the class, it becomes
evident that those shared in common with the reptiles are much more
numerous than those shared with the mammals. In this respect the views
of naturalists have changed within recent years. Formerly the two
characteristics shared with the mammals&mdash;the quadrilocular heart and
warm blood&mdash;were deemed evidences of the close affinity of the two
groups, and they were consequently combined as a section of the
vertebrates, under the name of Warm-blooded Vertebrates. But recently
the tendency has been, and very justly, to consider the birds and
reptiles as members of a common group, separated on the one hand from
the mammals and on the other from the batrachians; and to this
combination of birds and reptiles has been given the name
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sauropsida</i>.</p>

<p><!--012.png--><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg xiii]</span>
As already indicated, the range of variation within this class is
extremely limited; and if our views respecting the taxonomic value of
the subdivisions are influenced by this condition of things, we are
obliged to deny to the groups of living birds the right which has
generally been conceded of ranking as orders.</p>

<p>The greatest distinctions existing among the living members of the
class are exhibited on the one hand by the Ostriches and Kiwis and the
related forms, and on the other by all the remaining birds.</p>

<p>These contrasted groups have been regarded by Professor Huxley as of
ordinal value; but the differences are so slight, in comparison with
those which have received ordinal distinction in other classes, that
the expediency of giving them that value is extremely doubtful; and
they can be combined into one order, which may appropriately bear the
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eurhipidura</i>.</p>

<p>An objection has been urged to this depreciation of the value of the
subdivisions of the class, on the ground that the peculiar adaptation
for flight, which is the prominent characteristic of birds, is
incapable of being combined with a wider range of form. This is, at
most, an explanation of the cause of the slight range of variation,
and should not therefore affect the exposition of the <em>fact</em> (thereby
admitted) in a classification based on morphological characteristics.
But it must also be borne in mind that flight is by no means
incompatible with extreme modifications, not only of the organs of
flight, but of other parts, as is well exemplified in the case of bats
and the extinct pterodactyls.</p>

<p>Nor is the class of birds as now limited confined to the single order
of which only we have living representatives. In fossil forms we have,
if the differences assumed be confirmed, types of two distinct orders,
one being represented by the genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Archæopteryx</i> and another by the
genera <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ichthyornis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apatornis</i> of Marsh. The first has been
named <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saururæ</i> by Hæckel; the second <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ichthyornithides</i> by Marsh.</p>

<p>Compelled thus to question the existence of any groups of ordinal
value among recent birds, we proceed now to examine the grounds upon
which natural subdivisions should be based. The prominent features in
the classification of the class until recently have been the divisions
into groups distinguished by their adaptation for different modes of
life; that is, whether aerial or for progression on land, for wading
or for swimming; or, again, into Land and Water Birds. Such groups
have a certain value as simply artificial combinations, but we must
not be considered as thereby committing ourselves to such a system as
a natural one.</p>

<p>The time has scarcely arrived to justify any system of classification
hitherto proposed, and we can only have a sure foundation after an
exhaustive study of the osteology, as well as the neurology and
splanchnology, of the various members. Enough, however, has already
been done to convince us that the subdivision of the class into Land
and Water Birds does not express
<!--013.png--><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg xiv]</span>
the true relations of the members
embraced under those heads. Enough has also been adduced to enable us
to group many forms into families and somewhat more comprehensive
groups, definable by osteological and other characters. Such are the
Charadrimorphæ, Cecomorphæ, Alectoromorphæ, Pteroclomorphæ,
Peristeromorphæ, Coracomorphæ, Cypselomorphæ, Celeomorphæ, Aëtomorphæ,
and several others. But it is very doubtful whether the true clew to
the affinities of the groups thus determined has been found in the
relations of the vomer and contiguous bones. The families, too, have
been probably, in a number of cases, especially for the passerine
birds, too much circumscribed. The progress of systematic ornithology,
however, has been so rapid within the last few years, that we may be
allowed to hope that in a second edition of this work the means may be
furnished for a strictly scientific classification and sequence of the
families. (T. N. G.)</p>

<p>A primary division of recent birds may be made by separation of the
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a</i>) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ratitæ</i>, or struthious birds and their allies,&mdash;in which the
sternum has no keel, is developed from lateral paired centres of
ossification, and in which there are numerous other structural
peculiarities of high taxonomic import,&mdash;from the (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">b</i>) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carinatæ</i>,
including all remaining birds of the present geologic epoch. Other
primary divisions, such as that into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Altrices</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Præcoces</i>
of Bonaparte, or the corresponding yet somewhat modified and improved
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Psilopaedes</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ptilopaedes</i> of Sundevall, are open to the serious
objections that they ignore the profound distinctions between
struthious and other birds, require too numerous exceptions, cannot be
primarily determined by examination of adult specimens, and are based
upon physiological considerations not necessarily co-ordinate with
actual physical structure.</p>

<p>In the following scheme, without attempting to indicate positive
taxonomic rank, and without committing myself finally, I present a
number of higher groups into which Carinate birds may be divided,
capable of approximately exact definition, and apparently of
approximately equivalent taxonomic value. Points of the arrangement
are freely drawn from the writings of various authors, as will be
perceived by those competent to judge without special references. I am
particularly indebted, however, to the late admirable and highly
important work of Professor Sundevall,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> from which very many
characters are directly borrowed. The arrangement, in effect, is a
modification of that adopted by me in the “Key to North American
Birds,” upon considerations similar to those herewith implied. The
main points of difference are non-recognition of three leading groups
of aerial, terrestrial, and natatorial birds,&mdash;groups without
morphological basis, resting simply upon teleological modification; a
general depreciation of the taxonomic value of the several groups,
conformably with the considerations presented in the preceding pages
of this work; abolishing of the group <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Grallatores</i>; and recognition
of a primary group <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphenisci</i>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span></p>

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phalaropodidæ</i>). Hallux always reduced, obviously elevated and free,
or wanting; giving a foot of cursorial character. Wings, with few
exceptions, lengthened, pointed, and flat; the inner primaries and
outer secondaries very short, forming a strong re-entrance on the
posterior border of the wing. Tail shorter than the wing, of simple
form, and of few feathers, except in certain Snipes. Head globose,
sloping rapidly down to the contracted base of the bill, completely
feathered (except <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Philomachus</i> <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>). Gape of bill short and
constricted; tip usually obtuse; bill weak and flexible. Rostrum
commonly lengthened, and more or less terete and slender; membranous
wholly or in great part, without hard cutting edges. Nostrils narrow,
placed low down, entirely surrounded with soft skin; nasal fossæ
extensive. Palate schizognathous. Sternum usually doubly, sometimes
singly, notched. Carotids double. Pterylosis of a particular pattern.
Nature præcocial and ptilopædic. Comprising the “Plover-Snipe” group;
species of medium and small size, with never extremely compressed or
depressed body; more or less aquatic, living on plains and in open
places, usually near water, nesting on the ground, where the young run
freely at birth.</p>

cleft, or with movable basal webbing. Hallux (as compared with that of
the preceding and following group) lengthened, free, and either
perfectly incumbent or but little elevated, with a large claw, giving
a foot of insessorial character. Wings commonly obtuse, but broad and
ample, without marked re-entrance on posterior border, the
intermediate remiges not

often independently lobate. Bill lamellate, i. e., furnished along
each commissural edge with a regular series of mutually adapted laminæ
or tooth-like processes, with which correspond certain laciniate
processes of the fleshy tongue, which ends in a horny tip. Bill large,
thick, high at base, depressed towards the end, membranous to the
broad obtuse tip, which is occupied by a horny “nail” of various

<p>Having thus presented and defined an arrangement of the higher groups
into which recent Carinate birds are susceptible of division, I next
proceed to the consideration of the North American Families of birds
which the authors of the present work have provisionally adopted as
suitable to the end they had in view. Professor Baird urges the
caution that the scheme is intended merely for the convenient
determination of the North American species, aware that in many
instances diagnoses or antitheses of entire pertinence in such
application would fail or be negatived by consideration of the exotic
forms. The arrangement of the families here adopted is essentially
that presented in 1858 in Professor Baird’s “Birds of
<!--019.png--><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg xx]</span>
North America,”
modified somewhat in accordance with more recent views of Professor
Sundevall and others. But before proceeding to the analysis of the
families, I will introduce an artificial clew to the preceding higher
groups as adopted, so far as they are represented by North American
species.</p>

Recurring now to consideration of the North American <em>Families</em> of the
foregoing higher groups, I take up the latter in the natural order in
which they have been presented, giving under head of each such group
an analysis of the North American families by which it is represented,
reiterating the caution that the characters are drawn up only with
reference to the North American genera, and are, consequently, not
necessarily or always applicable upon wider considerations. These
analyses are made as nearly natural as the state of the case permits,
but I seize upon any obvious external characters which may be
afforded, without regard to their morphological significance or
taxonomic value.</p>

<h2 class="p2"><span class="sc">Family</span> <b class="birdname">TURDIDÆ</b>.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Thrushes.</span></h2>

<p class="p2">The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdidæ</i>, with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saxicolidæ</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cinclidæ</i>, form a group
closely related, by common characters, and appreciably different from
the other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oscines</i> with slender bills and specially insectivorous
habits, having, like them, ten primaries (the first much shorter than
the second, but nearly always appreciable), and the nostrils
uncovered. The great family of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvicolidæ</i>, with similar characters
of the bill, never present more than nine primaries. The most striking
of these common characters is seen in the deeply cleft toes, of which
the outer is united by the basal joint alone to the middle toe, while
the inner is separated almost to the very base of its first joint.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_21" id="fnanchor_21"></a><a href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span>
The frontal feathers extend, with rare exceptions, to the very
nostrils. The bill is elongated and subulate, moderately slender, and
usually notched at tip; the culmen moderately curved from the base,
and the mouth well provided with bristles, except in a few cases.
Usually the scutellæ covering the front and sides of the tarsus are
fused into one continuous plate, or else scarcely appreciable, except
on the inner edge only; in the Mocking Thrushes they are, however,
distinctly marked. The lateral toes are nearly equal, the outer rather
the longer. With these as some of the principal characteristics, they
may be distinguished from each other as follows:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;In the present work the length of the tail is measured from the
coccyx, inside of the skin, and not, as usually the case, from the
base of the quills at their insertion. The wings are measured from the
carpal joint, with dividers.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><!--029.png--><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span>
<b class="subset">A.</b> Nostrils oval. Loral and frontal feathers with bristly points, or
interspersed with bristles; rictus with longer or shorter bristles.</p>

<p class="blockquote1"><b class="birdname">Saxicolidæ.</b> Wings very long and much pointed, reaching beyond the
  middle of the short square or emarginated tail, and one and a half
  times or more the length of the latter. The spurious primary very
  short, the second quill longer than the fourth. In the closed wing
  the outer secondary reaches only about two thirds the length of
  longest primary.</p>

<p class="blockquote1"><b class="birdname">Turdidæ.</b> Wings moderate, more rounded, not reaching beyond middle of
  the often rounded tail, and not more than one and a third the
  latter, usually more nearly equal. Spurious primary sometimes half
  the length of second quill; the second quill shorter than the
  fourth. In the closed wing the outer secondary reaches three fourths
  or more the length of longest primary.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><b class="subset">B.</b> Nostrils linear, in lower edge of nasal membrane. Loral and frontal
feathers soft and downy, and no bristles or bristly points whatever
about the mouth.</p>

<p class="blockquote1"><b class="birdname">Cinclidæ.</b> Body very short and broad. Wings short, rounded, and
  concave.</p>

<p>The American <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylviidæ</i> are in some respects very closely related to
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saxicolidæ</i>, but may be distinguished by their much smaller size,
more slender and depressed bill, more strongly bristled rictus, etc.;
on which account they are more strictly “fly-catchers,” taking their
prey in great part on the wing.</p>

<p>Of the three families, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdidæ</i> contain a great variety of forms,
and exhibit widely different characters, rendering it exceedingly
difficult to arrange them in any systematic or regular sequence, or to
accurately define their boundaries. In the <cite>Birds of North America</cite>,
the Mocking Thrushes were placed among the Wrens, on account of the
distinct tarsal scutellæ, and other characters. We are now, however,
inclined to believe, with Dr. Sclater, that their place is with the
recognized <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdidæ</i>; and, among other reasons, on the ground of their
more deeply cleft toes, and greater extension forward of frontal
feathers. The following synopsis of the North American forms will
serve the purpose of determining the genera, even if these are not
arranged or combined in a strictly natural manner.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;In the Review of American Birds, <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, May, 1866, 409, I have

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdidæ</i> in a group <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myiadestinæ</i>. The relationships are certainly
very close, as is shown by the characters given below.</p>

<p>There are several American genera of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdinæ</i> not found north of
Mexico as yet, although it is not impossible that one of these
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catharus</i>) may hereafter be detected within the limits of the United
States. The species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catharus</i> resemble the North American
wood-thrushes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hylocichla</i>); but the spurious or first primary quill
is longer (from one half to one third the second quill), the wings are
rounded, not pointed, the tarsus is longer than the head, and the
outstretched toes extend beyond the tail. The species to be looked for
are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. melpomene</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">occidentalis</i>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_22" id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The North American species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdinæ</i>, while retained under the
single genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus</i>, yet constitute several distinct groups, which
we may call subgenera.</p>

long and pointed, with
small first primary (less than one fourth the second); wings
considerably longer than the tail, which is firm, nearly even, with
broad feathers. Tarsi variable, seldom as long as the skull, the
scutellæ fused into a continuous plate, only in rare individual
instances showing indications of the lines of separation.</p>

<p>The genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus</i> is very cosmopolitan, occurring nearly throughout
the globe, excepting in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Australia</i>, and embraces species of highest
perfection as singers. In the large number of species known there are
many variations in external form, but the transition from one to the
other is so gradual as to render it very difficult to separate them
into different genera. The sections of the group we adopt are the
following:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center small"><i class="subset">Sexes similar.</i></p>

<p class="small"><b class="birdname">Hylocichla.</b> Smallest species. Bill short, broad at base; much depressed.
Tarsi long and slender, longer than middle toe and claw, by the

whitish; breast spotted; throat without spots.</p>

<p class="small"><b class="birdname">Turdus.</b> Bill stouter and higher. Tarsi stout and short, scarcely longer

</div>

<p>The essential characters of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hylocichla</i> have already been given. The
subgenus includes the small North American species, with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus
mustelinus</i>, <abbr title="Gmelin">Gm.</abbr>, at the head as type, which are closely connected on
the one side with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catharus</i>, by their lengthened tarsi, and with
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus</i> by the shape of the wing. The bills are shorter, more
depressed, and broader at base than in typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus</i>, so much so
that the species have frequently been described under <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Muscicapa</i>.</p>

<p>It is not at all improbable that naturalists may ultimately conclude
to consider the group as of generic rank.</p>

<p>In this group there appears to be five well-marked forms or “species.”
They are, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mustelinus</i>, <abbr title="Gmelin">Gm.</abbr>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pallasi</i>, <abbr title="Cabanis">Caban.</abbr>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscescens</i>,
<abbr title="Stephens">Steph.</abbr>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">swainsoni</i>,
<!--032.png--><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>
<abbr title="Cabanis">Caban.</abbr>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aliciæ</i>, Baird. The first-named is
totally unlike the rest, which are more closely related in appearance.</p>

<p>In studying carefully a very large series of specimens of all the
species, the following facts become evident:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. In autumn and winter the “olive” color of the plumage assumes a
browner cast than at other seasons; this variation, however, is the
same in all the species (and varieties), so that in autumn and winter
the several species differ from each other as much as they do in
spring and summer.</p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 250px">
 <img src="images/i_032.jpg"
 width="250" height="284"
 alt="Turdus ustulatus."
 />
 <p class="center small"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus ustulatus.</i><br /></p>
</div>

<p>Of these five species, two only (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pallasi</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">swainsoni</i>) inhabit
the whole breadth of the continent; and they, in the three Faunal
Provinces over which they extend, are modified into “races” or
“varieties” characteristic of each region. The first of these species,
as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pallasi</i> <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pallasi</i>, extends westward to the Rocky
Mountains, and migrates in winter into the South; specimens are very
much browner in the winter than in spring; but in the Rocky Mountain
region is a larger, grayer race, the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auduboni</i>. This, in its
migrations, extends along the central mountain region through Mexico
to Guatemala; specimens from the northern and southern extremes of
this range are identical in all the specific characters; but the
southern specimens, being in the fall and winter dress, are browner in
color than northern ones (spring birds); an autumnal example from
Cantonment Burgwyn, <abbr title="New Mexico">N. M.</abbr>, is as brown as any Central American
specimen. Along the Pacific Province, from Kodiak to Western Mexico,
and occasionally straggling eastward toward the Rocky Mountain system,
there is the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nanus</i>, a race <em>smaller</em> than the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pallasi</i>, and with much the same colors as <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auduboni</i>, though
the rufous of the tail is deeper than in either of the other forms. In
this race, as in the others, there is no difference in size between
specimens from north and south extremes of its distribution, because
the breeding-place is in the North, all Southern specimens being
winter sojourners from their Northern birthplace.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. swainsoni</i> is found in abundance westward to the western limit
of the Rocky Mountain system; in the latter region specimens at all
seasons have the olive of a clearer, more greenish shade than in any
Eastern examples; this clearer tint is analogous with that of the
Rocky Mountain form of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pallasi</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auduboni</i>). In precisely the same
region inhabited by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pallasi</i> <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nanus</i> the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">swainsoni</i> also
has a representative form,&mdash;the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ustulatus</i>. This resembles in
pattern the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">swainsoni</i>, but the olive above is decidedly more
rufescent,&mdash;much as in Rocky Mountain specimens of
<!--033.png--><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. fuscescens</i>; the
spots on jugulum and breast are also narrower, as well as hardly
darker in color than the back; and the tail is longer than in Rocky
Mountain <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">swainsoni</i>, in which latter it is longer than in Eastern
examples. The remaining species&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mustelinus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscescens</i>, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aliciæ</i>&mdash;extend no farther west than the Rocky Mountains; the first
and last only toward their eastern base, while the second breeds
abundantly as far as the eastern limit of the Great Basin.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. fuscescens</i>, from the Rocky Mountains, is considerably darker in
color above, while the specks on the throat and jugular are sparser or more
obsolete than in Eastern birds.</p>

<p>In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. mustelinus</i>, the only two Western specimens in the collection
(Mount Carroll, <abbr title="Illinois">Ills.</abbr>, and Fort Pierre) have the rump of a clearer grayish
than specimens from the Atlantic Coast; in all other respects, however,
they appear to be identical. Some Mexican specimens, being in winter
plumage, have the breast more buffy than Northern (spring or summer)
examples, and the rufous of the head, etc. is somewhat brighter.</p>

<p>In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aliciæ</i>, no difference is observed between Eastern and Western birds;
the reason is, probably, that the breeding-ground of all is in one province,
though their migrations may extend over two. There is, however, a marked
difference between the spring and autumn plumage; the clear grayish of
the former being replaced, in the latter, by a snuffy brown, or sepia tint,&mdash;this
especially noticeable on wings and tail.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Wood Thrush, without being anywhere a very abundant
species, is common throughout nearly every portion of the United States
between the Mississippi River and the Atlantic. It breeds in every
portion of the same extended area, at least as far as Georgia on the south
and Massachusetts on the north. Beyond the last-named State, it rarely,
if ever, breeds on the coast. In the interior it has a higher range, nesting
around Hamilton, <abbr title="Canada West">C. W.</abbr> So far as I am aware it is unknown, or very rare,
in the States of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.</p>

<p>It makes its appearance early in April in the Middle States, but in New
England not until four or five weeks later, appearing about the 10th of May.
Their migrations in fall are more irregular, being apparently determined by
the abundance of their food. At times they depart as early as the first
of September, but sometimes not until the last of October. It winters
in Central America, where it is quite abundant at that season.</p>

<p>The favorite localities of the Wood Thrush are the borders of dense
thickets, or low damp hollows shaded by large trees. Yet its habits are
by no means so retiring, or its nature so timid, as these places of resort
would lead us to infer. A small grove in Roxbury, now a part of Boston,
in close proximity to a dwelling-house, was for many years the favorite
resort of these birds, where several pairs nested and reared their young,
rarely even leaving their nests, which were mostly in low bushes, wholly
unmindful of the curious children who were their frequent visitors. The
same fearless familiarity was observed at Mount Auburn, then first used
as a public cemetery. But in the latter instance the nest was always
placed high up on a branch of some spreading tree, often in conspicuous
places, but out of reach. Mr. J. A. Allen refers to several similar instances
where the Wood Thrush did not show itself to be such a recluse as many
describe it. In one case a pair built their nest within the limits of a
thickly peopled village, where there were but few trees, and a scanty
undergrowth. In another a Wood Thrush lived for several successive
summers among the elms and maples of Court Square in the city of
<!--038.png--><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>
Springfield, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, undisturbed by the passers by or the walkers beneath,
or the noise and rattle of the vehicles on the contiguous streets.</p>

<p>The song of this thrush is one of its most remarkable and pleasing
characteristics. No lover of sweet sounds can have failed to notice it,
and, having once known its source, no one can fail to recognize it when
heard again. The melody is one of great sweetness and power, and consists
of several parts, the last note of which resembles the tinkling of a small bell,
and seems to leave the conclusion suspended. Each part of its song seems
sweeter and richer than the preceding.</p>

<p>The nest is usually built on the horizontal branch of a small forest-tree,
six or eight feet from the ground, and, less frequently, in the fork of a bush.
The diameter is about 5 inches, and the depth 3¾, with a cavity averaging
3 inches across by 2¼ in depth. They are firm, compact structures, chiefly
composed of decayed deciduous leaves, closely impacted together, and apparently
thus combined when in a moistened condition, and afterward
dried into a firmness and strength like that of parchment. These are
intermingled with, and strengthened by, a few dry twigs, and the whole
is lined with fine roots and a few fine dry grasses. Occasionally, instead
of the solid frame of impacted leaves, we find one of solidified mud.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Wood Thrush, usually four in number, sometimes five,
are of a uniform deep-blue tint, with but a slight admixture of yellow,
which imparts a greenish tinge. Their average measurements are 1.00 by
.75 inch.</p>

<span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species is one of the common birds of New England, and is
probably abundant in certain localities throughout all the country east of the
Rocky Mountains, as far to the north as the 50th parallel, and possibly
as far as the wooded country extends. Mr. Maynard did not meet with
it in Northern New Hampshire. Mr. Wm. G. Winton obtained its nest
and eggs at Halifax, <abbr title="Nova Scotia">N. S.</abbr>; Mr. Boardman found them also on the Gulf
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence, and at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s, <abbr title="New Brunswick">N. B.</abbr>; Mr. Couper at Quebec; Mr.
Krieghoff at Three Rivers, Canada; Donald Gunn at Selkirk and Red
River; and Mr. Kumlien and Dr. Hoy in Wisconsin. Mr. McIlwraith
also gives it as common at Hamilton, West Canada. It breeds as far south
as Pennsylvania, and as far to the west as Utah, and occurs, in the breeding
season, throughout Maine, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Canada.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found this thrush very abundant among the thickets in the
valleys of the Provo, Weber, and Bear rivers, in Utah, and very characteristic
of those portions of the country.</p>

<p>It arrives in Massachusetts early in May, usually with the first blossoms
of the pear, ranging from the 5th to the 20th. It is strictly of woodland
habits, found almost entirely among clumps of trees, and obtaining its food
from among their branches, or on the ground among the fallen leaves. It
moves south from the 10th to the 25th of September, rarely remaining till
the first week in October.</p>

<p>It is timid, distrustful, and retiring; delighting in shady ravines, the edges
of thick close woods, and occasionally the more retired parts of gardens;
where, if unmolested, it will frequent the same locality year after year.</p>

<p>The song of this thrush is quaint, but not unmusical; variable in its
character, changing from a prolonged and monotonous whistle to quick
and almost shrill notes at the close. Their melody is not unfrequently
prolonged until quite late in the evening, and, in consequence, in some
portions of Massachusetts these birds are distinguished with the name of
Nightingale,&mdash;a distinction due rather to the season than to the high quality
of their song. Yet Mr. Ridgway regards it, as heard by himself in Utah,
as superior in some respects to that of all others of the genus, though far
surpassed in mellow richness of voice and depth of metallic tone by that of
the Wood Thrush (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. mustelinus</i>). To his ear there was a solemn harmony
and a beautiful expression which combined to make the song of this surpass
that of all the other American Wood Thrushes. The beauty of their notes
appeared in his ears “really inspiring; their song consisting of an inexpressibly
delicate metallic utterance of the syllables <i class="birdcall">ta-weel´ ah, ta-weel´ ah,
twil´ ah, twil´ ah</i>, accompanied by a fine trill which renders it truly seductive.”
The last two notes are said to be uttered in a soft and subdued
undertone, producing thereby, in effect, an echo of the others.</p>

<p>The nest is always placed near the ground, generally raised from it by
a thick bed of dry leaves or sticks; sometimes among bushes, but never in
the fork of a bush or tree, or if so, in very rare and exceptional cases.
<!--040.png--><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>
When incubation has commenced, the female is reluctant to leave her nest.
If driven off she utters no complaint, but remains close at hand and returns
at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>They construct their nest early in May, and the young are hatched in the
latter part of that month, or the first of June. They raise two broods in the
season. The nest, even more loosely put together than that of the Ground
Swamp Robin (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. pallasi</i>), is often with difficulty kept complete. It is
about 3 inches in height, 4½ in diameter, with a cavity 1½ inches deep and
3 in width, and composed of dry bark, dead leaves, stems, and woody fibres,
intermingled with grasses, caricas, sedges, etc., and lined with soft skeleton
leaves. A nest from Wisconsin was composed entirely of a coarse species of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sparganeum</i>; the dead stalks and leaves of which were interwoven with a
very striking effect.</p>

<p>The eggs, usually four, sometimes five in number, are of a uniform green
color, with a slight tinge of blue, and average .94 by .66 of an inch in
diameter.</p>

<p>As originally described, this species differs from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">swainsoni</i> in larger
size, longer bill, feet, and wings especially, straighter and narrower bill.
The back is of a greener olive. The breast and sides of the head are
entirely destitute of the buff tinge, or at best this is very faintly indicated
on the upper part of the breast. The most characteristic features are seen
on the side of the head. Here there is no indication whatever of the light
line from nostril to eye, and scarcely any of a light ring round the eye,&mdash;the
whole region being grayish-olive, relieved slightly by whitish shaft-streaks
on the ear-coverts. The sides of body, axillars, and tibiæ are
olivaceous-gray, without any of the fulvous tinge seen in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">swainsoni</i>.
The bill measures .40 from tip to nostril, sometimes more; tarsi, 1.21;

wing, 4.20; tail, 3.10,&mdash;total, about 7.50. Some specimens slightly exceed
these dimensions; few, if any, fall short of them.</p>

<p>In autumn the upper surface is somewhat different from that in spring,
being less grayish, and with a tinge of rich sepia or snuff-brown, this
becoming gradually more appreciable on the tail.</p>

<p>A specimen from Costa Rica is undistinguishable from typical examples
from the Eastern United States.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species, first described in the ninth volume of the Pacific
Railroad Surveys, bears so strong a resemblance to the Olive-backed Thrush
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. swainsoni</i>), that its value as a species has often been disputed. It was
first met with in Illinois. Since then numerous specimens have been obtained
from the District of Columbia, from Labrador, and the lower
Mackenzie River. In the latter regions it was found breeding abundantly.
It was also found in large numbers on the Anderson River, but was rare
on the Yukon, as well as at Great Slave Lake, occurring there only as a
bird of passage to or from more northern breeding-grounds.</p>

<p>In regard to its general habits but little is known. Dr. Coues, who
found it in Labrador, breeding abundantly, speaks of meeting with a family
of these birds in a deep and thickly wooded ravine. The young were just
about to fly. The parents evinced the greatest anxiety for the safety of
their brood, endeavoring to lead him from their vicinity by fluttering from
bush to bush, constantly uttering a melancholy <i class="birdcall">pheugh</i>, in low whistling
tone. He mentions that all he saw uttered precisely the same note, and
were very timid, darting into the most impenetrable thickets.</p>

<p>This thrush is a regular visitant to Massachusetts, both in its spring and
in its fall migration. It arrives from about the first to the middle of May,
and apparently remains about a week. It passes south about the first of
October. Occasionally it appears and is present in Massachusetts at the
same time with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus swainsoni</i>. From this species I hold it to be
unquestionably distinct, and in this opinion I am confirmed by the observations
of two very careful and reliable ornithologists, Mr. William Brewster
of Cambridge, one of our most promising young naturalists, and Mr. George
O. Welch of Lynn, whose experience and observations in the field are
unsurpassed. They inform me that there are observable between these
two forms certain well-marked and constant differences, that never fail
to indicate their distinctness with even greater precision than the constant
though less marked differences in their plumage.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus aliciæ</i> comes a few days the earlier, and is often in full song
when the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. swainsoni</i> is silent. The song of the former is not only
totally different from that of the latter, but also from that of all our
other Wood Thrushes. It most resembles the song of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. pallasi</i>, but
differs in being its exact inverse, for whereas the latter begins with its
lowest notes and proceeds on an ascending scale, the former begins with
its highest, and concludes with its lowest note. The song of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. swainsoni</i>,
<!--042.png--><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>
on the other hand, exhibits much less variation in the scale, all the
notes being of nearly the same altitude.</p>

<p>I am also informed that while the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. swainsoni</i> is far from being a timid
species, but may be easily approached, and while it seems almost invariably
to prefer the edges of the pine woods, and is rarely observed in open grounds
or among the bare deciduous trees, the habits of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. aliciæ</i> are the exact
reverse in these respects. It is not to be found in similar situations, but
almost always frequents copses of hard wood, searching for its food among
their fallen leaves. It is extremely timid and difficult to approach. As
it stands or as it moves upon the ground, it has a peculiar erectness of
bearing which at once indicates its true specific character so unmistakably
that any one once familiar with its appearance can never mistake it for
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. swainsoni</i> nor for any other bird.</p>

<p>The nests measure about 4 inches in diameter and 2¾ in height. The
cavity is 2 inches deep, and its diameter 2½ inches. They are unusually
compact for the nest of a thrush, and are composed chiefly of an elaborate
interweaving of fine sedges, leaves, stems of the more delicate <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Equisetaceæ</i>,
dry grasses, strips of fine bark, and decayed leaves, the whole intermingled
with the paniculated inflorescence of grasses. There is little or no lining
other than these materials. These nests were all found, with but few
exceptions, on the branches of low trees, from two to seven feet from
the ground. In a few exceptional cases the nests were built on the
ground.</p>

<p>Occasionally nests of this species are found constructed with the base
and sides of solid mud, as with the common Robin (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus migratorius</i>).
In these, as also in some other cases, their nests are usually found on or
near the ground. So far as I am aware neither its occasional position
on the ground, nor its mud frames, are peculiarities ever noticeable in
nests of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. swainsoni</i>.</p>

<p>The eggs were usually four in number. Their color is either a deep
green tint, or green slightly tinged with blue; and they are marked with
spots of russet and yellowish-brown, varying both in size and frequency.
Their mean length is .92 of an inch, and their mean breadth .64. The
maximum length is .94 and the minimum .88 of an inch. There is
apparently a constant variation from the eggs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. swainsoni</i>; those
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aliciæ</i> having a more distinctly blue ground color. The nests are
also quite different in their appearance and style of structure. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hypnum</i>
mosses, so marked a feature in the nests of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. swainsoni</i>, as also in those of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. ustulatus</i>, are wholly wanting in those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. aliciæ</i>.</p>

<p>This bird and the robin are the only species of our thrushes that cross
the Arctic Circle to any distance, or reach the shore of the Arctic Ocean.
It occurs from Labrador, all round the American coast, to the Aleutian
Islands, everywhere bearing its specific character as indicated above. It is
extremely abundant on and near the Arctic coast, between the mouth of
<!--043.png--><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>
the Mackenzie River and the Coppermine, more than 200 specimens
(mostly with their eggs) having been sent thence to the Smithsonian
Institution by Mr. MacFarlane. In all this number there was not a
single bird that had any approach to the characters of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. swainsoni</i>, as
just given. From the Slave Lake region, on the other hand, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. swainsoni</i>
was received in nearly the same abundance, and unmixed during the
breeding season with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. aliciæ</i>.</p>

the sides washed with brownish-olive. Sides of the throat and fore part of the breast
with sub-rounded spots of well-defined brown, darker than the back; the rest of the
breast (except medially) with rather less distinct spots that are more olivaceous. Tibiæ

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>

<p>Specimens examined from the northern regions (Great Slave Lake, Mackenzie
River, and Yukon) to Guatemala; from Atlantic States to East
Humboldt Mountains, Nevada, and from intervening localities. The extremes
of variation are the <em>brownish</em>-olive of eastern and the clear <em>dark</em>
greenish-olive of remote western specimens. There is no observable difference
between a Guatemalan skin and one from Fort Bridger, Utah.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Olive-backed Thrush, or “Swamp Robin,” has very nearly
the same habitat during the breeding season as that of the kindred species
with which it was so long confounded. Although Wilson seems to have
found the nest and eggs among the high lands of Northern Georgia, it is yet
a somewhat more northern species. It does not breed so far south as
Massachusetts, or if so, the cases must be exceptional and very rare, nor
even in Western Maine, where the “Ground Swamp Robin” (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. pallasi</i>) is
quite abundant. It only becomes common in the neighborhood of Calais.
<!--044.png--><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>
It is, however, most widely distributed over nearly the entire continent,
breeding from latitude 44<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> to high Arctic regions. It winters in Guatemala
and southward as far as Ecuador and Brazil.</p>

<p>In its habits this thrush is noticeably different from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. pallasi</i>, being
much more arboreal, frequenting thick woods; rarely seen, except during its
migrations, in open ground, and seeking its food more among the branches
of the trees.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found this species very abundant among the Wahsatch
Mountains, where it was one of the most characteristic summer birds of
that region. It was breeding plentifully in the cañons, where its song
could be heard almost continually. It inhabited an intermediate position
between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. auduboni</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. fuscescens</i>, delighting most in the shrubbery
along the streams of the cañons and passes, leaving to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. auduboni</i> the
secluded ravines of the pine regions higher up, and to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. fuscescens</i> the
willow thickets of the river valleys. He did not meet with it farther west
than the East Humboldt Mountains. The song, in his opinion, resembles
that of the Wood Thrush (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. mustelinus</i>) in modulations; but the notes
want the power, while they possess a finer and more silvery tone.</p>

<p>The song of this species has a certain resemblance to that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. pallasi</i>,
being yet quite distinct, and the differences readily recognized by a familiar
ear. It is more prolonged; the notes are more equal and rise with more
regularity and more gradually, are richer, and each note is more complete in
itself. Its song of lamentation when robbed of its young is full of indescribable
pathos and beauty, haunting one who has once heard it long after.</p>

<p>When driven from the nest, the female always flies to a short distance
and conceals herself; making no complaints, and offering no resistance.</p>

<p>These birds, in a single instance, have been known to reach Eastern
Massachusetts early in April, in an unusually early season, but they
generally pass north a few weeks later. They make no prolonged stay,
and are with us rarely more than three or four days. Their return in
the fall appears to be, at times, by a more inland route. They are then
not so numerous near the coast, but occasionally are abundant.</p>

<p>Their nests in Nova Scotia, wherever observed, were among the thick
woods, on horizontal branches of a forest-tree, usually about five feet from
the ground. Those observed in the Arctic regions by Mr. Kennicott were
frequently not more than two feet from the ground.</p>

<p>The nests average about four inches in diameter and two in height, the
cavity being three inches wide by about one and a half deep. They are
more elaborately and neatly constructed than those of any other of our
thrushes, except perhaps of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. ustulatus</i>. conspicuous among the materials
are the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hypnum</i> mosses, which by their dark fibrous masses give a very
distinctive character to these nests, and distinguish them from all except
those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. ustulatus</i>, which they resemble. Besides these materials are
found fine sedges, leaves, stems of equisetaceous plants, red glossy vegetable
<!--045.png--><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>
fibres, the flowering steins of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cladonia</i> mosses, lichens, fine strips of
bark, etc.</p>

<p>The eggs, which are four or five in number, exhibit noticeable variations
in size, shape, and shades of coloring, bearing some resemblance to those
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. ustulatus</i> and to the eggs asserted to be those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. nanus</i>, but are
sufficiently distinct, and are still more so from those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. aliciæ</i>. They
range in length from .83 to .94, with a mean of .88, their mean breadth
is .66, the maximum .69, and the minimum .63. Their ground color is
usually bluish-green, sometimes light blue with hardly a tinge of green,
and the spots are of a yellowish-brown, or russet-brown, or a mixture of
both colors, more or less confluent, with marked variations in this respect.</p>

General appearance of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscescens</i>, but with pattern of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">swainsoni</i>; the buff
orbital ring as conspicuous as in latter. The olive above is more <em>brown</em> than in this, and
less yellowish than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscescens</i>, becoming decidedly more rufescent on wings and less
observably so on tail. Pectoral aspect different from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscescens</i>, the spots narrower and
cuneate, sharply defined, and arranged in longitudinal series; in color they are a little
<em>darker</em> than the crown. Length, 7.50; wing, 3.75; tail, 3.00; tarsus, 1.12.</p>

Pacific Province of United States. Tres Marias <abbr title="Island"> Isl.</abbr>, Guatemala (winter),

<p>This well-marked race is to be compared with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">swainsoni</i>, not with
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscescens</i>, as has generally been done; the latter, except in shade of
colors, it scarcely resembles at all; still greater evidence that such is its
affinity is that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. ustulatus</i> builds its nest on a tree, and lays a spotted
egg, like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">swainsoni</i>, while <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscescens</i> nests on or near the ground, perhaps
never in a tree, and lays a plain blue egg. The song of the present bird is
also scarcely distinguishable from that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">swainsoni</i>. Upon the whole, we
see no reason why this should not be considered as a Pacific Province form
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus swainsoni</i>; at least it becomes necessary to do so, after
referring to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. pallasi</i> as geographical races, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. auduboni</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. nanus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> So far as we are aware, this thrush has a very limited distribution,
being mainly restricted to the Pacific coast region from California to
Alaska in the breeding season, though migrating southward in winter to
Guatemala. Dr. Kennerly found it in great abundance breeding at Chiloweyuck
Depot, July 3, 1859. Dr. Cooper also found it one of the most
abundant of the summer residents in Washington Territory, arriving there
<!--046.png--><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>
in May and remaining until the beginning of September. Three specimens
of this thrush were obtained at Sitka, by Mr. Bischoff. Mr. Ridgway met
with only a single specimen east of the Sierra Nevada, though on that range
he found it an abundant summer bird.</p>

<p>In its general appearance it has a marked resemblance to Wilson’s Thrush
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. fuscescens</i>), but its habits and notes, as well as its nest and eggs, clearly
point its nearer affinity to Swainson’s Thrush (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. swainsoni</i>), its song being
scarcely different from that of the latter species. Like this species, it frequents
the thickets or brushwood along the mountain streams, and, except
just after its arrival, it is not at all shy. In crossing the Sierra Nevada in
July, 1867, Mr. Ridgway first met with this species. He describes it as an
exquisite songster. At one of the camps, at an altitude of about 5,000 feet,
they were found unusually plentiful. He speaks of their song as consisting
of “ethereal warblings,&mdash;outbursts of wild melody.” “Although its carols
were heard everywhere in the depth of the ravine, scarcely one of the little
musicians could be seen.” “The song of this thrush,” he adds, “though
possessing all the wild, solemn melody of that of the Wood Thrush (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T.
mustelinus</i>) is weaker, but of a much finer or more silvery tone, and more
methodical delivery. It is much like that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. swainsoni</i>, but in the
qualities mentioned is even superior.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found its nests with eggs about the middle of June. These
were most usually built on a small horizontal branch, and were very strongly
constructed of twigs, grasses, roots, and leaves, usually covered on the outside
entirely with the bright green <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hypnum</i> mosses peculiar to that region, which
in the damp climate near the coast continue to grow in that position, and
form large masses. The number of eggs is usually five.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper states that these thrushes sing most in the early morning and
in the evening, when numbers may be heard answering one another on all
sides. They do not affect the darkest thickets so much as the Hermit
Thrush, but are often seen feeding in the gardens in the open sunshine.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley, who found them quite abundant in the neighborhood of Fort
Steilacoom, on the edge of the forest, and in swampy land, describes the song
as a low, soft, sad, and lively whistle, confined to one note, and repeated at
regular intervals. Mr. Nuttall, the first to describe this form, speaks of
it as shy and retiring, and as in the habit of gathering insects from the
ground. His ear, so quick to appreciate the characteristics of the songs of
birds, which showed a close resemblance between the notes of this bird and
that of Wilson’s Thrush (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. fuscescens</i>), enabled him to detect very distinct
and easily recognizable differences. It is much more interrupted and is not
so prolonged. The warble of this bird he describes as resembling <i class="birdcall">wit-wit
t´villia</i>, and <i class="birdcall">wit-wit, t´villia-t´villia</i>. His call when surprised was <i class="birdcall">wit-wit</i>.</p>

<p>All the nests of this species that have fallen under my observation are
large, compact, strongly constructed, and neat. They measure about 5
inches in their external diameter, with a depth externally of 3; the cavity
<!--047.png--><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>
is comparatively shallow, being rarely 2 inches in depth. The external
portions are constructed almost entirely of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hypnum</i> mosses, matted together
and sparingly interwoven with dry leaves and fine fibrous roots,
and are lined with finer materials of the same kind. These nests most
nearly resemble in their material and in their position those of Swainson’s
Thrush.</p>

<p>Mr. Hepburn found these birds very abundant about Victoria. It does
not usually breed there before the last of May, though in one exceptional
instance he found a nest with young birds on the 24th of that month.</p>

<p>The eggs vary in size and shape, ranging from .77 to .94 in length, and
from .65 to .69 in breadth. They also vary in their ground color and in the
tints of the spots and markings. The ground color is light green or light
blue, and the markings are variously yellowish-brown and lilac, or dark
brown and slate.</p>

<p>Mr. Grayson found this thrush very abundant in the month of January,
in the thickest of the woods, in the islands of the Three Marias, on the
Pacific coast of Mexico. They were very timid and shy, more so than any
bird that he saw on those islands. It frequently uttered a low plaintive
whistle, and seemed solitary in its habits.</p>

<p>In spring the olive above is very much that of eastern specimens of

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Until quite recently the “Ground Swamp Robin,” or Hermit
<!--048.png--><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>
Thrush, has not been distinguished from the closely allied species <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. swainsoni</i>,
and all accounts of writers have blended both in singular confusion.
My colleague, Professor Baird, in the summer of 1844, was the first to suggest
the distinctness of the two species. By the common people of Maine
and the British Provinces this difference has long been generally recognized,
this species being known as the “Ground Swamp Robin,” and the other as
the “Swamp Robin.”</p>

<p>The present species is found throughout Eastern North America to the
Mississippi, and breeds from Massachusetts to high arctic regions. It is
only occasionally found breeding so far south as Massachusetts; through
which State it passes in its spring migrations, sometimes as early as the 10th
of April; usually reaching Calais, Maine, by the 15th of the same month.</p>

<p>It is a very abundant bird throughout Maine, where it begins to breed
during the last week of May, and where it also probably has two broods
in a season.</p>

<p>The greater number appear to pass the winter in the Southern States; it
being common in Florida, and even occasionally seen during that season as
far north as latitude 38<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> in Southern Illinois, according to Mr. Ridgway.</p>

<p>It rarely, if ever, sings during its migrations; appears in small straggling
companies, frequents both thickets and open fields, and is unsuspicious and
easily approached.</p>

<p>The song of this species is very fine, having many of the characteristics
of that of the Wood Thrush (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. mustelinus</i>). It is as sweet, has the same
tinkling sounds, as of a bell, but is neither so powerful nor so prolonged,
and rises more rapidly in its intonations. It begins with low, sweet notes,
and ends abruptly with its highest, sharp ringing notes.</p>

<p>Taken from the nest they are easily tamed, and are quite lively and
playful; but their want of cleanliness renders them very undesirable pets.
When their nest is visited they make no complaints, but retire to a distance.
Not so, however, when their natural enemy, the hawk, appears; these they
at once assail and seek to drive away, uttering loud and clear chirps, and
peculiar twittering sounds.</p>

<p>The nest of this thrush is always built on the ground, most generally
either under low bushes or in the open ground, rarely, if ever, among
thick trees, and for the most part in low swampy places. Both nest and
eggs closely resemble those of Wilson’s Thrush (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. fuscescens</i>). In Parsboro,
Nova Scotia, I found one of the nests built in the very midst of the
village, close to a dwelling, though on a spot so marshy as to be almost
unapproachable. The nests are 3 inches in height and 5 in diameter, with
a cavity 3¼ inches wide by 1¾ deep. They are composed of decayed deciduous
leaves, remnants of dried plants, sedges and grasses, intermingled with
twigs, and lined with finer grasses, sedges, and strips of bark.</p>

<p>The eggs are of a uniform bluish-green color, and range in length from .88
to .94, with an average of .63 of an inch.

the tail abruptly darker, richer, and more <em>purplish</em>-rufous, approaching to chestnut. The
clear olive of the neck passes into brownish-<em>plumbeous</em> along sides; pectoral spots more
sparse and less pure black than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. pallasi</i>. The white beneath is of an almost snowy

<p class="small">A very tangible and constant character possessed by this bird is the more slender and
depressed bill, as compared with that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. pallasi</i>. Specimens vary only in intensity of
colors; these variations very limited, and corresponding with those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. pallasi</i>. In all
cases, however, their precise pattern and peculiar distribution is retained.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Western Province of North America, eastward from Kodiak to Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas.
Arizona, <span class="sc">Coues</span>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This small race of the Hermit Thrush was first noticed by Dr.
Pickering, and described by Mr. Audubon from an imperfect skin. It
has since been obtained abundantly on the Pacific slope, and Mr. Ridgway
procured a specimen as far east as the East Humboldt Mountains, which
he considers its eastern limit.</p>

<p>In its habits it is said to be, like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. pallasi</i>, almost exclusively terrestrial.
Dr. Heermann mentions finding it abundant in California, and breeding
among the stunted oaks covering the sand-hills of San Francisco. Dr.
Coues found it in Arizona, but speaks of it as rare and migratory, occurring
chiefly in spring and autumn, and as a shy and retiring species. Dr. Cooper,
in his Report on the Birds of California, describes it as shy and timid, preferring
dark and shady thickets, feeding chiefly on the ground, running
rapidly, and searching for insects among the leaves.</p>

<p>Near San Diego they began to sing about the 25th of April. The song,
consisting of a few low ringing notes, resembles that of Wilson’s Thrush
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. fuscescens</i>), and also that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. ustulatus</i>, but is not so loud. Their note
of alarm is a loud and ringing chirp, repeated and answered by others at a
long distance.</p>

<p>At Santa Cruz, on the first of June, Dr. Cooper met with several of their
nests, which, though probably erroneously, he supposed to belong to the
Dwarf Hermit Thrush. They were all built in thickets under the shade
of cottonwood-trees. Each nest was about five feet from the ground, and
all contained eggs, from two to four in number, in differing stages of incubation.
The nests were built of dry leaves, roots, fibres, grasses, and bark,
<!--050.png--><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>
without any mud, and were lined with decayed leaves. Their height and external
diameter measured 4 inches. The diameter of the cavity was 2½ inches
and the depth 2¼. The eggs measured .90 by .70 of an inch. They are of a
pale bluish-green, speckled with cinnamon-brown, chiefly at the larger end.</p>

<p>The nest, supposed to be of this species, supplied by Dr. Cooper, is large
for the bird; constructed of a base loosely made up of mosses, lichens, and
coarse fibres of plants. It is a strong and compact structure of matted
leaves, put together when in a moist and decaying condition; with these
there are interwoven roots, twigs, and strong fibres, surrounding the nest
with a stout band and strengthening the rim. In fact, it corresponds so well&mdash;as
do the eggs also&mdash;with those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. ustulatus</i>, that it is extremely probable
that they really belong to that species. The only observable difference
is the absence of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hypnum</i> mosses characteristic of northern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ustulatus</i>.</p>

<p>Dall and Bannister mention in their list of Alaska birds that the species
is not common there. It was also taken at Sitka and Kodiak by Bischoff.</p>

<p>The fact that this thrush builds its nest above the ground, and lays
spotted eggs, if verified, would at once warrant our giving it independent
rank as a species, instead of considering it as a local race of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pallasi</i>.</p>

<p>This is a very distinct race of thrushes, although it may be questioned
whether it be truly a species. It is, however, sufficiently distinct from the
eastern and western Hermit Thrushes to warrant our giving it a place of
some kind in the systems.</p>

<p>The young plumage differs from that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pallasi</i> as do the adults of the
two, and in about the same way. The olive is very much purer, with a
greenish instead of a brownish cast, and the tail is very much lighter,
inclining to dull ochraceous instead of rufous; this yellowish instead of
rufous cast is apparent on the wings also. The yellowish “drops” on head,
back, etc., are very much narrower than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pallasi</i>, while the greater coverts,
instead of being distinctly tipped with yellowish, merely just perceptibly
fade in color at tips.</p>

<p><!--051.png--><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>
<span class="sc">Habits.</span> At present we have but little knowledge of the habits of this form
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. pallasi</i>, and no information whatever regarding its nesting or eggs.</p>

<p>In its distribution it is confined to the central range of mountains from
Fort Bridger to Southern Mexico. This species, there known as “Solitario,”
is common in the Alpine region of Vera Cruz (as well as in all the elevated
regions of Central Mexico), frequenting the pine woods in the district of
Orizaba. Mr. Sumichrast obtained it at all seasons of the year at Moyoapam,
in that vicinity; a locality the height of which approximates 2,500 metres.
It is also found at a height of 1,200 metres, near the city of Orizaba.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway calls this bird the “Rocky Mountain Hermit Thrush.”
He states that he found it common in the Wahsatch Mountains, but that,
on account of its retiring habits, it was seldom seen. It there lives
chiefly in the deep ravines in the pine region, exhibiting an attachment to
these solitudes rather than to the thickets along the watercourses lower
down; the latter it leaves to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. swainsoni</i>. Owing to the reserved
manners of this bird, as well as to the great difficulty of reaching its abode,
there were few opportunities presented for learning much concerning its
habits, nor did he hear its song. In its flight the pale ochraceous band across
the bases of its quills was a very conspicuous feature in the appearance of
its species, leading Mr. Ridgway to mistake it at first for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myiadestes
townsendii</i>,&mdash;also an inhabitant of the same localities,&mdash;so much did it
look like that bird, which it further resembled in its noiseless, gliding flight.</p>

Greenland, in the New World.</p>

<p>The occurrence of this well-known European species in Greenland brings
it within the limits of the American Fauna. Two Greenland specimens are
recorded by Dr. Reinhardt: one of them shot at Frederickshaab, October 20,
1845.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Redwing can probably only claim a place in the fauna of
North America as an occasional visitant. Of the two specimens observed
in Greenland, one was shot late in October. It is not known to breed there.</p>

<p>This species, during its breeding season, is found only in the more northern
portions of Europe; only occasionally, and very rarely, breeding so far south
as England. It makes its appearance in that kingdom on its southern migrations,
coming in large flocks from Northern and Northeastern Europe, and
arriving usually before the end of October. During their stay in England
they frequent parks and pleasure-grounds that are ornamented with clumps
of trees. During mild and open weather they seek their subsistence in
pasture lands and moist meadows, feeding principally on worms and snails.
In severe winters, when the ground is closed by frost or covered by snow,
the Redwings are among the first birds to suffer, and often perish in large
numbers.</p>

<p>During the winter they extend their migrations to the more southern portions
of Europe, to Sicily, Malta, and even to Smyrna. In early spring they
return to the more central portions of the continent, and leave in May for
their more northern places of resort.</p>

<p>They nest in trees in the moist woods of Norway and Sweden. Their
nests resemble those of the common Fieldfare, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. pilaris</i>. The outside is
composed of sticks, weeds, and coarse grass, gathered wet, and matted with a
small quantity of moist clay. They are lined with a thick bed of fine grass.</p>

<p>The Redwing is said to possess a delightful note, and is called the Nightingale
of Norway. Linnæus, speaking of this bird, claims that its high
and varied notes rival even those of that far-famed vocalist.</p>

<p>During the summer the Redwing advances to the extreme north, visiting
<!--053.png--><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>
the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Northern Russia. The general character
of its food, its inability to feed exclusively on berries, and the fact that
it perishes from starvation in severe winters, would seem to prove that its
occurrence in Greenland so late as October must have been purely accidental.
It is not probable that its presence in North America will be found
to be a common event.</p>

<p>The eggs measure 1.06 inches in length by .81 in breadth. The ground
color is a light green with a bluish tinge thickly covered with russet or
reddish-brown spots, confluent at the larger end.</p>

<p>This section of the Thrushes is well represented in America, especially in
its middle and southern portions, and its members have a close resemblance
to the typical European
species in the full form,
stout legs, etc., as already
stated. The spots on the
throat, and their absence
elsewhere on the under

<p>There are some variations, both
of color and proportions, between
eastern and western specimens of
the Robin. In the latter there is
a tendency to a longer tail, though
the difference is not marked; and,
as a rule, they slightly exceed eastern
specimens in size. The broad
white tip to the lateral tail-feather&mdash;so
conspicuous a mark of eastern
birds&mdash;is scarcely to be found
at all in any western ones; and in
the latter the black of the head
is very sharply defined against the
lighter, clearer ash of the back, there hardly ever being a tendency in it
to continue backward in the form of central spots to the feathers, as is
almost constantly seen in eastern examples; of western specimens, the
rufous, too, is appreciably lighter than in eastern. As regards the streaks
on the throat, the black or the white may either largely predominate in
specimens from one locality.</p>

<p><!--055.png--><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>
In autumn and winter each rufous feather beneath is bordered by a more
or less conspicuous crescent of white; in addition to this, most of the lighter
individuals (<abbr title="female symbol">♀</abbr>?), at this season, have an ashy suffusion over the breast and
flanks; and this, we have observed, is more general and more noticeable in
western than in eastern specimens. In fall and winter the color of the bill,
too, changes, becoming at this season either partially or wholly dusky, instead
of almost entirely yellow, as seen in spring and summer examples.</p>

<p>Mexican specimens, found breeding in the Alpine regions as far south
as Orizaba and Mirador, most resemble the western series; one, however
(<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 38,120 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, Orizaba), but in the autumnal plumage, and therefore
very possibly a migrant from the North, is hardly distinguishable from
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 32,206, Georgia; it is about identical in proportions, and the rufous is
of a castaneous shade, like the deepest colored eastern examples; the white
tip to the outer tail-feather is as broad and conspicuous as is ever seen in
the latter.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Scarcely any American bird has a wider range of geographical
distribution, or is more numerous wherever found, than this thrush. From
Greenland on the extreme northeast to the plateau of Mexico, and from
the Atlantic to the Pacific, the Robin is everywhere a very abundant species.
Single specimens have been obtained as far south as Coban, Guatemala. Its
distribution in the breeding season is hardly less restricted, occurring alike
on the shores of the Arctic Seas and on the high lands of Vera Cruz.
In the winter months it is most abundant in the Southern States, while
in the Middle and even the Northern States, in favorable localities, it
may be found throughout the year; its migrations being influenced more
by the question of food than of climate. In the valleys among the White
Mountains, where snow covers the ground from October to June, and where
the cold reaches the freezing-point of mercury, flocks of the Robin remain
during the entire winter, attracted by the abundance of berries.</p>

<p>On the Pacific Coast the Robin is only a winter visitant in California; a
very few remaining to breed, and those only among the hills. They reach
Vancouver Island early in March, and are very abundant.</p>

<p>In New England, where the Robins are held in great esteem, and where
they exist under very favorable circumstances, their numbers have very
largely increased, especially in the villages. They cause not a little annoyance
to fruit cultivators by their depredations upon the productions of the
garden, especially cherries and strawberries. They are a voracious bird, and
no doubt destroy a large quantity of small fruit, but there is abundant evidence
that this is more than compensated by their destruction of the most
injurious insects, upon which they wage an incessant war. The investigations
of Mr. J. W. P. Jenks and Professor Treadwell establish conclusively
their great services in this direction.</p>

<p>The experiments of the latter gentleman show that the nestlings of the
Robin require a vast amount of animal food, forty per cent more than their
own weight being consumed by the young bird within twenty-four hours,
and, what is more, demonstrated to be necessary to its existence.</p>

In Massachusetts a few Robins remain throughout the year, but the greater
proportion leave early in November, returning late in February or early in
March.</p>

<p>The song of the Robin is deservedly popular. While many of our birds
possess far superior powers of melody, and exhibit a much greater variety in
their song, there are none that exceed it in its duration or extent. It is the
first bird in spring to open and one of the last to close the great concert of
Nature. Their song is earnest, simple, and thrilling, and is said by Audubon
to resemble that of the European Blackbird, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus merula</i>.</p>

<p>The Robin, when taken young, may be readily tamed, and soon becomes
contented and accustomed to confinement. They are devoted to their young,
watchful, attentive, and provident. They begin to construct their nest in
early spring before the trees put forth their leaves, and often in very exposed
positions. The size of the nest, in fact, makes concealment impossible.
These nests are sometimes placed in quite remarkable positions, such as
the beams of a ship partly finished, and where the carpenters were every
day at work, and similar situations indicating a great familiarity. Their
favorite place is the horizontal branch of an apple-tree, about ten feet from
the ground.</p>

<p>The nest of the Robin is a large and coarsely constructed combination of
rude materials. It is composed of a base of straw, leaves, mosses, stems,
and dry grasses, upon which a cup-shaped fabric of clay or mud is built.
The whole is lined with finer dry grasses and vegetable fibres. They
average 5 inches in height and the same in diameter. Their cavity is
2¾ inches deep, with a diameter of 2½ inches.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Robin, which are usually five and sometimes six in number,
are of a uniform bright greenish-blue color, liable to fade when exposed
to light, but when fresh exhibiting a very distinct and bright tint. They
vary in size from 1.25 to 1.12 inches in length, and in breadth from .88 to
.75 of an inch. Their mean measurement is 1.18 by .81.</p>

The central portions of the feathers of the top of head are rather darker than the
edges, though almost inappreciably so, and not imparting a general dusky appearance.
The chin and throat are white, streaked with ashy-brown. The jugulum and breast are
<!--059.png--><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>
pale yellowish-buff; the axillars, inner wing-coverts, and sides of the breast similarly, but
rather more decidedly colored. The belly and edges of the crissal feathers are white, the
hinder parts of the flanks ashy. There is a distinct whitish stripe from the lores over
and a quarter of an inch behind the eye; the lower eyelid is also white. The tail-feathers
are worn, but there is an indication of a narrow white tip. The feathers of the jugulum,
especially of the sides, are tipped with ashy like the back, as in immature specimens
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. migratorius</i>. The greater wing-coverts are tipped with dull white. The bill is yellowish;
the upper mandible and the tip of lower tinged with dusky. The feet are pale
brown.</p>

<p class="small">The length cannot be given accurately, as the skin is much drawn up. The wing, however,
measures 5.10 inches, its tip reaching 1.40 beyond the longest secondary; tail, 4.10;

<p>The specimen with a general resemblance to an immature <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. migratorius</i>
(especially the western variety) in the white superciliary streak and general
markings, is much lighter beneath than in any of the many skins of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. migratorius</i>
examined; there being none of the dark chestnut or cinnamon
shade, but rather a light buff; the belly and flanks are much more purely
white. The superciliary stripe extends farther behind the eye; indeed, in
most specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">migratorius</i> the white is nearly confined to the eyelids.
The bill and wings are rather longer than usual in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">migratorius</i>; the middle
toe, on the other hand, appears shorter. Nothing is on record in regard to
the habits of this bird.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The accidental occurrence of a few specimens of this well-marked
bird in the Eastern States
is its only claim to a place in that
fauna, it being strictly a western
species, belonging to the Pacific
Coast. It was first discovered by
the naturalists of Captain Cook’s
expedition, who met with it as far
to the north as Nootka Sound. It
is only very recently that we have
become possessed of reliable information
in regard to its breeding
and its nest and eggs. Sir John
Richardson was informed that it
nested in bushes in a manner similar
to that of the common robin.</p>

<p>Nuttall and Townsend found it abundant among the western slopes of the
<!--061.png--><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>
Rocky Mountains, near the Columbia River, in October. In the winter it
became still more numerous, passing the season in that region as well as in
more southern localities, associating with the robin. From this bird it may
be readily distinguished by the difference of its notes, which are louder,
sharper, and delivered with greater rapidity. In the spring, before leaving
for their breeding-places, they are described as having a very sweet warble.</p>

<p>On the Columbia River they were not resident, arriving there in October,
continuing throughout the winter, and leaving early in May. During their
stay they moved through the forest in small flocks, frequenting low trees,
and for the most part keeping perfect silence. They were timorous and difficult
of approach.</p>

<p>Its habits are said to resemble those of the robin, but in some of them
the descriptions given appear to correspond more with those of the Fieldfares
and Redwings of Europe. Like those species it is a summer resident of
high northern latitudes, affects secluded forests and thickets bordering upon
streams, and is found only in unfrequented localities.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper was of the opinion that a few of these thrushes remained in
Washington Territory throughout the summer, as he frequently met with
them in the dark spruce forests of that region as late as June and July.
He describes the song as consisting of five or six notes in a minor key, and
in a scale regularly descending. It was heard continually throughout the
summer, among the tops of the trees, but only in the densest forests. Dr.
Suckley states that after a fall of snow they would be found along the sandy
beaches near the salt water, where they were both abundant and tame. We
are indebted to Mr. W. H. Dall for our first authentic knowledge of its
nest and eggs. The former measures 6 inches in diameter with a depth of
2½ inches. It has but a very slight depression, apparently not more than
half an inch in depth. The original shape of the nest had, however, been
somewhat flattened in transportation. The materials of which it was composed
were fine dry mosses and lichens impacted together, intermingled with
fragments of dry stems of grasses.</p>

<p>A nest of this thrush obtained by Dr. Minor, in Alaska, is a much more
finished structure. Its base and periphery are composed of an elaborate
basket-work of slender twigs. Within these is an inner nest consisting of
an interweaving of fine dry grasses and long gray lichens.</p>

<p>The eggs in size, shape, ground color, and markings are not distinguishable
from those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus musicus</i> of Europe. They measure 1.13 inches in
length by .80 in breadth, are of a light blue with a greenish shading, almost
exactly similar to the ground color of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. migratorius</i>. They are very
distinctly marked and spotted with a dark umber-brown approaching almost
to blackness.</p>

<p>Mr. Dall informs us that the nest found by him was built in a willow
bush, about two feet from the ground, and on the top of a large mass of
rubbish lodged there by some previous inundation. Other nests of the
<!--062.png--><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>
same species were met with in several places between Fort Yukon and
Nulato, always on or near a river-bank and in low and secluded localities.</p>

<p>They arrive at Nulato about May 15, and prefer the vicinity of water,
frequenting the banks of small streams in retired places. Mr. Dall states
that he has seen the male bird on a prostrate log near the nest, singing with
all his might, suddenly cease and run up and down the log for a few minutes,
strutting in a singular manner, then stopping and singing again; and keeping
up this curious performance. Specimens were received from Sitka, Kodiak,
Cook’s Inlet and Admiralty Islands.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Subfamily</span> <span class="ls"><b class="birdname">MIMINÆ</b></span>.</p>

<p>Birds of this section have a somewhat thrush-like appearance, but (except
in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oreoscoptes</i>) with longer, much more graduated, and broader tail; short
concave wings, about equal to or shorter than the tail, usually lengthened,
sometimes decurved bill without notch, and strongly marked scutellæ on the
anterior face of the tarsus. The loral feathers are soft, and not ending in
bristly points. The colors are dull shades of brown, gray, or plumbeous.
Most of the species, in addition to a melodious native song, possess the
power of imitating the notes of other birds; sometimes, as in the American
Mocking Bird, to an eminent degree. All are peculiar to the New World,
and the species are much less vagrant than those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdinæ</i>,&mdash;those
of the United States scarcely going beyond its northern boundary; others,
again, restricted to small islands in the West Indies or in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

Bill shorter than the head, without distinct notch. Bristles prominent, their
tips reaching beyond the nostrils. Wings pointed, equal to, or a little longer than the
tail. First quill not half the second, about
two fifths the longest; third, fourth, and
fifth quills equal and longest; second between
sixth and seventh. Tail but slightly
graduated; the feathers narrow. Tarsus
longer than middle toe and claw by an additional
claw; scutellæ distinct anteriorly.</p>

<p>Of this genus only one species is

<p>The careful observations of Mr. Robert Ridgway have led him to the conviction
that the name bestowed upon this species of “Mountain Mocking-Bird”
is doubly a misnomer. It is not at all imitative in its notes, and it is
almost exclusively a resident of the artemisia
plains. It seems to be chiefly
confined to the great central plateau of
North America, from Mexico almost to
Washington Territory. Specimens have
been procured from Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, the
Lower Colorado, Mexico, and Texas, on
the south, and Nuttall met with it nearly
as far north as Walla-Walla. It probably
occupies the whole extent of the
Great Basin.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly, who met with it while
crossing the arid <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mesas</i> west of the Rio
Grande, says that while singing it was
usually perched upon some bush or low tree. It was frequently seen
seeking its food upon the ground, and when approached, instead of flying
away, it ran very rapidly, and disappeared among the low bushes.</p>

<p>During the winter months it was observed near San Antonio, Texas, by
Mr. Dresser; and was also found by him to be common about Eagle Pass.
He noticed the same peculiarity of their running instead of their flying
away when disturbed. They preferred the flat, bush-covered plains. A few
remained to breed, as he obtained the eggs there, although he did not himself
meet with one of the birds in summer.</p>

<p>It is generally represented as keeping chiefly on the ground, and obtaining
<!--064.png--><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span>
its food in this position. General Couch speaks of it as Sparrow-like in its
habits.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall describes its song as cheering, and the notes of which it is
composed as decidedly resembling those of the Brown Thrush (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Harporhynchus
rufus</i>). He claims for it some of the imitative powers of the
Mocking-Bird (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mimus polyglottus</i>), but in this he is not supported by the
observations of others. He met with its nest in a wormwood (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Artemisia</i>)
bush on the border of a ravine; it contained four eggs of emerald green,
spotted with dark olive, the spots being large, roundish, and more numerous
at the larger end. The nest was composed of small twigs and rough stalks,
and lined with strips of bark and bison-wool. The female flew off to a short
distance, and looked at her unwelcome visitors without uttering any complaint.</p>

<p>The nests of this bird, so far as I have seen them, are all flat, shallow
structures, with very slight depression, and loosely and rudely constructed
of an intermingling of strips of bark with rootlets and the finer stems of herbaceous
plants. Their eggs, usually four in number, do not vary essentially
in size, shape, or marking. They measure 1 inch in length, and from .73 to
.75 in breadth. Their ground color is a bright greenish-blue, marked with
deep olive-brown spots, intermingled with blotches of a light lilac. There
are slight variations in the proportion of green in the shade of the ground
color, and also in the number and size of the spots, but these variations are
unimportant.</p>

<p>The following are Mr. Ridgway’s observations upon the habits of this
species. They are full, valuable, and very carefully made:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oreoscoptes montanus</i> is a bird peculiar to the artemisia wastes of the
Great Basin, being a characteristic species of the region between the Sierra
Nevada and the Rocky Mountains. It is exclusively an inhabitant of the
“sage brush,” and is partial to the lower portions of the country, though
it is not unfrequent on the open slope of the mountains. A more unappropriate
term than “Mountain Mocking-Bird” could hardly have been chosen
for this species, as its predilection for the valleys, and the fact that its song
is <em>entirely</em> its own, will show. In my opinion, the term “Sage Thrasher”
would be more appropriate.</p>

<p>In the neighborhood of Carson City, Nevada, these birds arrived about the
24th of March, and immediately upon their arrival began singing. At this
time, with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sturnella neglecta</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poospiza belli</i>, they made sweet music
in the afternoon and early morning, in the open wastes of “sage brush,”
around the city. The birds when singing were generally seen sitting upon
the summit of a “sage” bush, faintly warbling, in the course of the song
turning the head from side to side in a watchful manner. Upon being
approached, they would dart downward, seemingly diving into the bush upon
which they had perched, but upon a close search the bird could not be
found, until it was heard again singing a hundred yards or more in the
<!--065.png--><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>
direction from which I had approached. This peculiar, circuitous, concealed
flight is a very characteristic trait of this bird, and one sure to excite attention.</p>

<p>As the season advanced, or about the 10th of April, when the pairing
season was at hand, the songs of the males became greatly improved, increasing
in sweetness and vivacity, and full of rapturous emotion; their manners,
also, became changed, for they had lost all their wariness. In paying their
attentions to their mates, the males would fly from bush to bush, with a
peculiar, tremulous fluttering of the wings, which, when the bird alighted,
were raised above the back apparently touching each other; all the while
vibrating with the emotion and ecstasy that agitated the singer.</p>

<p>The song of this bird, though very deficient in power,&mdash;in this respect
equalling no other species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miminæ</i> with which I am acquainted,&mdash;is
nevertheless superior to most of them in sweetness, vivacity, and variety.
It has a wonderful resemblance to the beautiful subtle warbling of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Regulus calendula</i>, having in fact very much the same style, with much of
the tone, and about the power of the song of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyranga rubra</i>.</p>

<p>When the birds are engaged in incubation, the males become very silent,
and one not familiar with their habits earlier in the season would think they
never had a voice; in fact, they make no protestations even when the nest is
disturbed, for, while blowing the eggs, I have had the parent birds running
around me, in the manner of a robin, now and then halting, stretching forward
their heads, and eying me in the most anxious manner, but remaining
perfectly silent. When the young are hatched the parents become more
solicitous, signifying their concern by a low, subdued <i class="birdcall">chuck</i>. At all times
when the nest is approached, the bird generally leaves it slyly before one
approaches very near it.</p>

<p>The nest is very bulky, composed externally of rough sticks, principally
the thorny twigs of the various “sage bush” plants. Nearer the centre the
principal material is fine strips of inner bark of these plants; and the lining
consists of finer strips of bark, mingled with fine roots, and bits of rabbit
fur. The situation of the nest varies but little, being generally placed
near the middle of a bush, that is, about eighteen inches from the ground.
It is generally supported against the main trunk, upon a horizontal branch.
Several were found upon the ground beneath the bush, one, in fact, embedded
in the soil, like that of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilo</i>; or as sometimes the case with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Harporhynchus
rufus</i>, others, again, were found in brush-heaps. In all cases,
the nest was very artfully concealed, the situation being so well selected.</p>

<p>This bird is almost equally common in all parts of its habitat, within the
limits indicated. In June, we found it abundant on the large islands in the
Great Salt Lake, where many nests were found.</p>

<p>In autumn, it feeds, in company with many other birds, upon berries,
“service berries” being its especial favorite.</p>

with the bristles extending beyond
the nostrils. Tarsus long and stout,
appreciably exceeding the middle

<p>It is useless to attempt a division of this genus, for there is such a gradual
chain of characters between the two extremes of form (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rufus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crissalis</i>),
that they even seem almost one species,
when the numerous intermediate forms,
shading so insensibly into each other, are
considered. However, as this view would
be rather extreme, in view of the really
great difference of form between the species
mentioned, we may consider the following
as good species, several of them with one
or more varieties: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rufus</i>, with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">longicauda</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">longirostris</i> as varieties, the former
scarcely appreciably different, the latter
ranking as a permanent race; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ocellatus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cinereus</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curvirostris</i>, the latter with one well-marked
variety, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">palmeri</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">redivivus</i>, with
most probably <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lecontei</i> as a well-marked
variety, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crissalis</i>.</p>

<p>The seasonal differences in the plumage often make it difficult to determine
these several forms; but if the following facts are borne in mind, the
<!--067.png--><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>
trouble will be greatly lessened. In every species there is a more or less
decided ochraceous tinge to the crissal region (sometimes extending forward
over the flanks); except in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crissalis</i>, in which the lower tail-coverts and anal
region are deep chestnut. In autumn and winter this ochraceous tint becomes
very much deeper, as well as more prevalent, than in spring and
summer; the whole plumage becomes softer, the colors more pronounced,
and the markings more distinct, than when faded and worn in summer.</p>

Exposed portion of the bill shorter than the head. Outline of lower mandible
straight. Above light cinnamon-red; beneath pale rufous-white with longitudinal
streaks of dark brown, excepting on the chin, throat, middle of the belly, and under tail-coverts.
These spots anteriorly are reddish-brown in their terminal portion. The inner
surface of the wing and the inner edges of the primaries are cinnamon; the concealed
portion of the quills otherwise is dark brown. The median and greater wing-coverts
become blackish-brown towards the end, followed by white, producing two conspicuous
bands. The tail-feathers are all rufous, the external ones obscurely tipped with whitish; the
shafts of the same color with the vanes. Length, 11.15; wing, 4.15; tail, 5.20; tarsus, 1.30.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern North America to Missouri River, and perhaps to high central plains
United States, east of Rocky Mountains, north to Lake Winnipeg.</p>

<p><!--071.png--><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>
As stated in “Birds of North America” some specimens (<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">longicauda</i>)
from beyond the Missouri River are larger than eastern birds, with longer
tails, more rufous beneath; the breast spots darker. But, in passing from
east to west, the change is so insensible that it is impossible to divide the
series.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This Thrush is a common species throughout a widely extended
area, from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic, and from the Red River
country, in British America, to the Rio Grande. And nearly throughout
this entire territory it also resides and breeds, from Texas to the 54th parallel
of latitude.</p>

<p>It reaches New England early in May and leaves it in the latter part of
September or the first week of October, its stay varying with the season
and the supply of its food. It is somewhat irregularly distributed, common
in some portions of this section, and rare or even unknown in others. It
is not found near the sea-coast beyond Massachusetts. It passes the winter
in the Southern States, even as far to the north as Virginia, and is in full
song in the neighborhood of Savannah as early as the first of March.</p>

<p>The song of this Thrush is one of great beauty, and is much admired by
all who appreciate woodland melody of the sweetest and liveliest type. It
is loud, clear, emphatic, full of variety and charm. Its notes are never imitative
and cannot be mistaken by any one who is familiar with them, for
those of any other bird, unless it may be some one of its western congeners.
It is a very steady performer, singing for hours at a time. Its notes are
given in a loud tone, and its song may often be heard to quite a distance.</p>

<p>In obtaining its food the Brown Thrush is at times almost rasorial in its
habits. In the early spring it scratches among the leaves of the forest for
worms, coleopterous grubs, and other forms of insect food. By some it
is charged with scratching up the hills of early corn, but this is not a well-founded
accusation. Berries of various kinds also form a large part of its
food, and among these the small fruit of our gardens must be included.</p>

<p>This Thrush is a very affectionate and devoted bird, especially to its young.
It is also prompt in going to the assistance of others of its species when in
trouble. Whenever intruders approach their nests, especially if their young
are far advanced, they manifest the deepest anxiety, sometimes even making
a vigorous defence. The writer has a very distinct recollection of having
encountered, together with a younger brother, an ignominious defeat, when
making his first attempt to inspect the nest of one of these birds.</p>

<p>The Brown Thrush is jealous of the intrusion of other birds of its own
species to a too close proximity to its nesting-place, and will assert its
love of seclusion by stout battles. In Louisiana the construction of the
nest is commenced quite early in March; in Pennsylvania, not until May;
and in the New England States in the latter part of that month. The nest
is usually not more than two or three feet from the ground. It is built in a
low bush, on a cluster of briers or among vines. I have known it to be
<!--072.png--><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>
placed in the interior of a heap of brushwood loosely thrown together. I
have never met with the nest built upon the ground, but in Springfield, and
in other dry and sandy localities, this is by no means an uncommon occurrence.
These nests are frequently placed in close proximity to houses, and
sometimes in the very midst of villages.</p>

<p>The nest of the Thrasher is large, and roughly but strongly built. The
base is usually made of coarse twigs, sticks, and ends of branches, firmly
interwoven. Within this is constructed an inner nest, composed of dried
leaves, strips of bark, and strong black fibrous roots. These are lined
with finer roots, horse-hair, an occasional feather, etc.</p>

<p>The eggs are usually four, sometimes five, and rarely six, in number. They
vary both in the tints of the ground color, in those of their markings, and
slightly in their shape. Their length varies from .99 to 1.12 inches, with a
mean of 1.05. Their breadth ranges from .76 to .87 of an inch; mean
breadth, .81. The ground color is sometimes white, marked with fine reddish-brown
dots, confluent at the larger end, or forming a broad ring around the
crown. In others the markings have a yellowish-brown tint. Sometimes the
ground color is a light green.</p>

<p>Specimens from the Rio Grande to Mirador and Orizaba are quite identical,
with, of course, differences among individuals. This “species” is not, in
our opinion, separable from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. rufus</i> specifically; but is a race, representing
the latter in the region given above, where the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rufus</i> itself is never
found. The relations of these two forms are exactly paralleled in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thryothorus
ludovicianus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. berlandieri</i>, the latter being nothing more than
the darker Southern representation of the former.</p>

<p>The Texas Thrasher appears to belong only to the Avifauna of the Southwest.
<!--073.png--><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>
It first appears as a bird of the valley of the Rio Grande, and extends
from thence southward through Eastern Mexico to Cordova and Orizaba. In
Arizona it is replaced by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. palmeri</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. lecontei</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. crissalis</i>, in California
by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. redivivus</i>, and at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. cinereus</i>, while in the
United States east of the Rocky Mountains it is represented by its nearer
ally <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. rufus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The eggs of this species are hardly distinguishable from those
of the common Brown Thrasher (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. rufus</i>), of the Atlantic States. The
color of their ground is a greenish-white, which is thickly, and usually completely,
covered with fine markings of a yellowish-brown. They have an
average length of 1.13 inches, by .79 in breadth. So far as I have had an
opportunity of observing, they do not vary from these measurements more
than two per cent in length or one per cent in breadth. Their nests are
usually a mere platform of small sticks or coarse stems, with little or no
depression or rim, and are placed in low bushes, usually above the upper
branches.</p>

<p>In regard to the distinctive habits of this species I have no information.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, Lower California.</p>

<p>This species is curiously similar in coloration to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oreoscoptes montanus</i>, from
which its much larger size, much longer and decurved bill, and the graduated
<!--074.png--><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>
tail, of course readily distinguish it. It agrees in some respects with
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. rufus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. longirostris</i>, but is smaller, the bill longer and more curved;
the upper parts are ashy olivaceous-brown instead of rufous, etc.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> So far as is at present known in regard to this species it appears
to be confined exclusively to the peninsula of Lower California. It has, at
least, been met with nowhere else. Mr. Xantus found it quite numerous
in the vicinity of Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, in a region which, as he describes it, was
singularly unpropitious. This was a sandy shore, extending about a quarter
of a mile inland, whence a cactus desert stretched about six miles up to a
high range of mountains. Throughout this tract the ground is covered with
a saline efflorescence. There is no fresh water within twenty-eight miles.</p>

<p>Mr. Xantus speaks of the habits of this bird as being similar to those of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oreoscoptes montanus</i>. It was a very abundant species at this cape, where
he found it breeding among the cactus plants in large numbers. He mentions
that as early as the date of his arrival at the place, April 4, he found
them already with full-fledged young, and states that they continued to
breed until the middle of July.</p>

<p>He was of the impression that the eggs of this species more nearly resemble
those of the common Mocking-Bird than any others of this genus.
The aggravatingly brief notes that accompanied his collections show that the
general position of the nest of this species was on low trees, shrubs, and
most usually, cactus plants, and in no instance at a greater elevation from
the ground than four feet. Their nests were flat structures, having only a
very slight depression in or near their centre. They were about 5 inches
in diameter, and were very little more than a mere platform.</p>

<p>The eggs vary somewhat in their ground color, but exhibit only slight
variations in size or shape. Their greatest length is 1.13 inches, and their
average 1.12 inches. Their mean breadth is .77 inch, and their maximum
.79 inch. The ground color is a greenish-white, profusely marked with
spots of mingled purple and brown. In others the ground color is a bluish-green.
In some specimens the spots are of a yellowish-brown, and in some
the markings are much lighter.</p>

Exposed portion of the bill about as long as the head; considerably
decurved. Above uniform grayish-brown, or light ash; beneath dull white; the anal
region and under tail-coverts tinged with brownish-yellow. The under parts generally,
except the chin, throat, middle of the belly, and under coverts, with rounded sub-triangular,
quite well-defined spots, much like the back. These are quite confluent on the breast.
Two narrow bands on the wing-coverts, and the edges of primaries and alulæ, are white.
The tail-feathers, except the middle, are conspicuously tipped with white. Length of
female, 10 inches; wing, 4.00; tail, 4.55; tarsus, 1.20.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Adjacent regions of United States and Mexico, southward. Cordova, Orizaba,
Mirador; Mazatlan, Colima, Oaxaca.</p>

<p>Specimens from the Rio Grande across to Mazatlan represent one species;
but those from the latter locality are somewhat darker in colors, though this
may be owing, in part, to the fact that they are winter birds. Considerable
differences in proportions may often be noticed between individuals, but
nothing strikingly characteristic of any particular region.</p>

<p>The specimens of the Mazatlan series (37,326 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, 51,523, and 51,525 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>)
have tails considerably longer than any of those from the Rio Grande, the
excess amounting in the longest to nearly an inch; but one from the same
locality has it <em>shorter</em> than any of the Texas specimens.</p>

<p>In its perfect plumage, this species has both rows of coverts distinctly
tipped with white; but in the faded condition of midsummer, the bands
thus produced are hardly discernible, and the spots below become very
obsolete.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This interesting species appears to be common in Western Texas,
the valley of the Rio Grande, and Western Mexico. It was met with in
these regions on the several railroad surveys, and is described by Dr. Heermann
as possessing musical powers surpassed by few other birds. When
alarmed it immediately hides itself in a thick covert of underbrush, whence
it is almost impossible to dislodge it. Its food consists of fruit and berries
when in their season, of insects and their larvæ, and of worms. These it
collects both among the trees and from the ground, on the latter of which it
spends much of its time. Mr. J. H. Clark states that the nest of this bird
is very similar to that of the Mocking-Bird, but is finer and much more compact.
He adds that it is oftener found among the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Opuntia</i> than elsewhere.
It is a quiet bird, rather shy, and keeps closely within the clumps of the
chaparral. For a bird of its size it makes an unusual noise in flying. At
Ringgold Barracks Mr. Clark’s tent was pitched under a como-tree in which
there was a nest of these birds. They were at first shy and seemed quite
disposed to abandon their nest, but, however, soon became accustomed to
their new neighbor, and went on with their parental duties. The position
of their nest had been very judiciously selected, for it was during the season
of the black fruit of the como, which is somewhat in the shape and size of
a thimble, with a pleasant milky pulp. These constituted their principal
food. The eggs in this nest were five in number. Lieutenant Couch met
with it from Brownsville to Durango, where it had already paired as early as

February. He describes it as exceedingly tame and gentle in its habits, and
with a song remarkably melodious and attractive. Perched on the topmost
bough of a flowering mimosa, in the presence of his consort, the male will
pour forth a volume of most enchanting music. Their nest is generally very
nearly flat, measuring nearly six inches in circumference, and scarcely more
than an inch in its greatest thickness. It has hardly any distinct cavity,
and hollows but very slightly from the rim to the centre, its greatest depression
having barely the depth of half an inch. The nests are composed of
long coarse fibrous roots, rudely, but somewhat compactly interwoven. The
inner framework is constructed of the same materials intermixed with the
finer stems of grasses.</p>

<p>Mr. H. E. Dresser states that in the vicinity of Matamoras these birds are
fond of frequenting small villages, and that he frequently found their nests
within the gardens and court-yards of the houses, and near the road.</p>

<p>The eggs of this Thrush vary considerably in size, ranging from 1.20 to
1.03 inches in length, and from .84 to .77 of an inch in breadth. Their
mean length is 1.12 inches, and their average breadth .80. They have
a light green ground-color, generally, though not thickly, covered with fine
brown spots.</p>

the uniform colors and general appearance of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lecontei</i>. Were it not that the

species, its habitat being exactly between them, too. We have great pleasure

much to our knowledge of the Natural History of the interesting region
where the present bird is found.</p>

enclosed in an outer case of thorny sticks, thinly but strongly put together. This inner
nest has a deep cavity measuring 4 inches in diameter by 3 in depth.</p>

Bill much curved. Second quill about equal to the tenth; exposed portion
of the first more than half the longest; outer tail-feather an inch shortest. General color
above light grayish-ash, beneath much paler; the chin and throat above almost white;
the sides behind brownish-yellow or pale rusty-yellow ash, of which color is the crissum

<p>Since the description of the type, a second specimen (40,718 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, Fort
Mojave, 20 miles from Colorado River, <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 30, 1865) has been obtained
by Dr. Coues. This skin differs slightly from the type in size, being
somewhat larger, measuring, wing 3.90, tail 5.30, bill (from nostril) 1.05;
while the other measures, wing 3.70, tail 4.70, bill .98. This difference in
size very probably represents that between the sexes, the type most likely
being a female, though the sex is not stated. Owing to the different seasons
in which the two specimens were obtained, they differ somewhat in plumage
also. Dr. Coues’s specimen is somewhat the darker, and the plumage
has a softer, more blended aspect, and a more ashy tinge of color; the
ochraceous of the crissal region is also slightly deeper. No other differences
are appreciable.</p>

species. A single specimen was obtained by Dr. Leconte near Fort Yuma,
and described by Mr. Lawrence in 1851, and remained unique for many
years. In 1861 Dr. Cooper presented a paper to the California Academy
of Sciences, in which this bird is given among a list of those new to that
State. He then mentions that he found it common about the Mojave River,
and that he procured two specimens.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues, in his valuable paper on the birds of Arizona, speaks of obtaining,
in 1865, a specimen of this rare species on a dry plain covered thickly
with mesquite and cactus, near Fort Mojave. This bird was very shy and
restless, fluttered hurriedly from one cactus to another, until he at last shot
it where it seemed to fancy itself hidden among the thick fronds of a large
yucca. Its large stout feet admirably adapt it for its partially terrestrial
life, and it apparently spends much of its life upon the ground, where it
runs rapidly and easily. Its flight he describes as swift but desultory, and
accompanied by a constant flirting of the tail. He considers this species as
inhabiting the whole valley of the Colorado and Gila, and thinks that it
does not leave the vicinity of these streams for the mountains.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found a nest of this species, but without eggs, built in a yucca,
and similar to that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. redivivus</i>. In his Report on the Birds of California,
Dr. Cooper speaks of finding this bird common on the deserts, along
the route between the Colorado Valley, wherever there was a thicket of low
bushes surrounded by sand-hills. Its notes, habits, and general appearance
were like those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. redivivus</i>.</p>

Wing much rounded; the second quill shorter than the secondaries. Tail
much graduated. Bill much decurved, longer than the head. Above brownish-olive,
without any shade of green; beneath pale cinnamon, lightest on the throat, deepening
gradually into a brownish-rufous on the under tail-coverts. The fore part of the breast
and sides of the body brown-olive, lighter than the back. An obscure ashy superciliary
stripe, and another lighter beneath the eye. Ear-coverts and an indistinct maxillary stripe
dark brown; the shafts of the former whitish. Ends and tips of tail-feathers obsoletely
paler. Length, 11.50 inches; wing, 4.20; tail, 5.75; tarsus, 1.55.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Coast region of California.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The California Thrasher appears to have a somewhat restricted
distribution, being confined to the coast region of California, where, however,
it is quite abundant. It was first met with by Dr. Gambel, near Monterey.
The specimens were obtained on the ground where they were searching for
<!--079.png--><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span>
coleopterous insects. Dr. Heermann afterwards found this bird abundant
in the southern part of California. It was difficult of approach, diving into
the thick bushes, running some distance on the ground, and becoming afterwards
unapproachable. He speaks of its song as a flood of melody equalled
only by the song of the Mocking-Bird (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mimus polyglottus</i>). Colonel McCall
also describes its song as of exquisite sweetness, “placing it almost beyond
rivalry among the countless songsters that enliven the woods of America.”
He also states that it is as retiring and simple in its manners as it is brilliant
in song.</p>

<p>In the character of its flight it is said to strongly resemble the Brown
Thrasher (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. rufus</i>) of the Eastern States. Their harsh, scolding notes,
when their nest is approached, their motions and attitudes, are all very
similar to those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. rufus</i> under like circumstances. Colonel McCall
ranks the song of this species as far superior to that of any other Thrush.
Without possessing the powerful voice or imitative faculties of the Mocking-Bird,
its notes are described as having a liquid mellowness of tone, with
a clearness of expression and volubility of utterance that cannot be surpassed.</p>

<p>A nest of this bird found by Dr. Heermann was composed of coarse twigs,
and lined with slender roots, and not very carefully constructed. Mr. Hepburn
writes that a nest found by him was in a thick bush about five feet
from the ground. It was a very untidy affair, a mere platform of sticks,
almost as carelessly put together as that of a pigeon, in which, though not
in the centre, was a shallow depression about 4 inches in diameter, lined
with fine roots and grass. It contained two eggs with a blue ground thickly
covered with soot-colored spots confluent at the larger end, and in coloring
not unlike those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus ustulatus</i>. The eggs measured 1.19 inches
by .81 of an inch. Dr. Cooper gives their measurement as 1.10 of an inch
by .85. Two eggs belonging to the Smithsonian Institution (2,040, <i class="subset">a</i> and <i class="subset">b</i>)
measure, one 1.19 by .81, the other 1.14 by .93. The former has a bluish-green
ground sparsely spotted with olive-brown markings; the other has a
ground of a light yellowish-green, with numerous spots of a russet brown.</p>

<p>The general character of their nest is, as described, a coarse, rudely constructed
platform of sticks and coarse grass and mosses, with but a very
slight depression. Occasionally, however, nests of this bird are more carefully
and elaborately made. One (13,072) obtained near Monterey, by Dr.
Canfield, has a diameter of 6 inches, a height of 3, with an oblong-oval
cavity 2 inches in depth. Its outside was an interweaving of leaves, stems,
and mosses, and its lining fine long fibrous roots.</p>

<p>These birds are chiefly found frequenting the dense chaparral that lines
the hillsides of California valleys, forming thickets, composed of an almost
impenetrable growth of thorny shrubs, and affording an inviting shelter.
In such places they reside throughout the year, feeding upon insects, for
the procuring of which their long curved bills are admirably adapted, as
<!--080.png--><!--Plate 4-->
<!--081.png--><!--blank page-->
<!--082.png--><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span>
also upon the berries which generally abound in these places. Their nests
usually contain three eggs. Dr. Cooper states that their loud and varied
song is frequently intermingled with imitations of other birds, though the
general impression appears to be that they are not imitative, and do not
deserve to be called, as they often are, a mocking-bird.</p>

feet are, however, considerably smaller, the claws especially so; the tarsus
measures but 1.30, instead of 1.52; the middle claw .29, instead of .36.
With these differences in form, however, it would be impossible to separate

a female, is considerably smaller than the type, measuring only: wing, 3.90;
tail, 6.00; bill, from nostril, 1.15. The plumage is in the burnt summer
condition, and has a peculiar reddish cast.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Of this rare Thrush little is known. So far as observed, its
habits appear to be nearly identical with those of the Californian species
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. redivivus</i>). It is found associated in the same localities with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. lecontei</i>,
which also it appears to very closely resemble in all respects, so far as observed.
<!--083.png--><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>
The first specimen was obtained by Dr. T. C. Henry, near Mimbres,
and described by him in May, 1858, in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia
Academy of Sciences. A second specimen was obtained by H. B. Möllhausen,
at Fort Yuma, in 1863. Dr. Coues did not observe it at Fort
Whipple, but thinks its range identical with that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. lecontei</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found this species quite common at Fort Mojave, but so very
shy that he only succeeded in shooting one, after much watching for it.
Their song, general habits, and nest he speaks of as being in every way
similar to those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. redivivus</i>.</p>

<p>The eggs remained unknown until Dr. E. Palmer had the good fortune to
find them at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George, Southern Utah, June 8, 1870. The nest was an
oblong flat structure, containing only a very slight depression. It was very
rudely constructed externally of coarse sticks quite loosely put together;
the inner nest is made of finer materials of the same. The base of this
nest was 12 inches long, and 7 in breadth; the inner nest is circular, with a
diameter of 4½ inches.</p>

<p>The eggs are of an oblong-oval shape, one end being a little less obtuse
than the other. In length they vary from 1.15 to 1.12 inches, and in breadth
from .84 to .82 of an inch. They are of a uniform blue color, similar to the
eggs of the common Robin (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus migratorius</i>), only a little paler or of a
lighter tint. In the total absence of markings they differ remarkably from
those of all other species of the genus.</p>

Third and fourth quills longest; second about equal to eighth; the first
half or more than half the second. Tail considerably graduated. Above ashy brown, the
feathers very obsoletely darker centrally, and towards the light plumbeous downy basal
portion (scarcely appreciable, except when the feathers are lifted). The under parts are
white, with a faint brownish tinge, except on the chin, and with a shade of ash across
the breast. There is a pale superciliary stripe, but the lores are dusky. The wings and
tail are dark brown, nearly black, except the lesser wing-coverts, which are like the back;
the middle and greater tipped with white, forming two bands; the basal portion of the
primaries white; most extended on the inner primaries. The outer tail-feather is white,
sometimes a little mottled; the second is mostly white, except on the outer web and
towards the base; the third with a white spot on the end; the rest, except the middle,
very slightly or not at all tipped with white. The bill and legs are black. Length, 9.50;
wing, 4.50; tail, 5.00.</p>

<p>The Mocking-Birds are closely allied,
requiring careful comparison to distinguish
them. A near ally is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. orpheus</i>,

<p>We have examined one hundred and
fourteen specimens, of the present species,
the series embracing large numbers from
Florida, the Rio Grande, Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, and Mazatlan, and numerous
specimens from intermediate localities. The slight degree of variation
<!--085.png--><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>
manifested in this immense series is really surprising; we can discover
no difference of color that does not depend on age, sex, season, or the
individual (though the variations of the latter kind are exceedingly rare,
and when noticed, very slight). Although the average of Western specimens
have slightly longer tails than Eastern, a Florida example (No.
54,850, <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, Enterprise, <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 19), has a tail as long as that of the longest-tailed
Western one (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 8,165, Fort Yuma, Gila River, <abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr>). Specimens
from Colima, Mirador, Orizaba, and Mazatlan are quite identical with
Northern ones.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Mocking-Bird is distributed on the Atlantic coast, from
Massachusetts to Florida, and is also found to the Pacific. On the latter
coast it exhibits certain variations in forms, but hardly enough to separate it
as a distinct species. It is by no means a common bird in New England,
but instances of its breeding as far north as Springfield, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, are of constant
occurrence, and a single individual was seen by Mr. Boardman near
Calais, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr> It is met with every year, more or less frequently, on Long
Island, and is more common, but by no means abundant, in New Jersey. It
is found abundantly in every Southern State, and throughout Mexico. It
has also been taken near Grinnell, Iowa.</p>

<p>A warm climate, a low country, and the vicinity of the sea appear to be
most congenial to their nature. Wilson found them less numerous west of
the Alleghany than on the eastern side, in the same parallels. Throughout
the winter he met with them in the Southern States, feeding on the berries of
the red cedar, myrtle, holly, etc., with which the swampy thickets abounded.
They feed also upon winged insects, which they are very expert in catching.
In Louisiana they remain throughout the entire year, approaching farmhouses
and plantations in the winter, and living about the gardens and outhouses.
They may be frequently seen perched upon the roofs of houses and
on the chimney-tops, and are always full of life and animation. When the
weather is mild the old males may be heard singing with as much spirit as
in the spring or summer. They are much more familiar than in the more
northern States. In Georgia they do not begin to sing until February.</p>

<p>The vocal powers of the Mocking-Bird exceed, both in their imitative
notes and in their natural song, those of any other species. Their voice is
full, strong, and musical, and capable of an almost endless variation in modulation.
The wild scream of the Eagle and the soft notes of the Bluebird
are repeated with exactness and with apparently equal facility, while both in
force and sweetness the Mocking-Bird will often improve upon the original.</p>

<p>The song of the Mocking-Bird is not altogether imitative. His natural
notes are bold, rich, and full, and are varied almost without limitation.
They are frequently interspersed with imitations, and both are uttered with
a rapidity and emphasis that can hardly be equalled.</p>

<p>The Mocking-Bird readily becomes accustomed to confinement, and loses
little of the power, energy, or variety of its song, but often much of its sweetness
<!--086.png--><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span>
in a domesticated state. The mingling of unmusical sounds, like the
crowing of cocks, the cackling of hens, or the creaking of a wheelbarrow,
while they add to the variety, necessarily detracts from the beauty of his
song.</p>

<p>The food of the Mocking-Bird is chiefly insects, their larvæ, worms,
spiders, etc., and in the winter of berries, in great variety. They are said
to be very fond of the grape, and to be very destructive to this fruit. Mr.
G. C. Taylor (Ibis, 1862, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 130) mentions an instance that came to his
knowledge, of a person living near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine, Florida, who shot no less
than eleven hundred Mocking-Birds in a single season, and buried them at
the roots of his grape-vines.</p>

<p>Several successful attempts have been made to induce the Mocking-Bird
to rear their young in a state of confinement, and it has been shown to be,
by proper management, perfectly practicable.</p>

<p>In Texas and Florida the Mocking-Bird nests early in March, young birds
appearing early in April. In Georgia and the Carolinas they are two weeks
later. In Pennsylvania they nest about the 10th of May, and in New York
and New England not until the second week of June. They select various
situations for the nest; solitary thorn-bushes, an almost impenetrable thicket
of brambles, an orange-tree, or a holly-bush appear to be favorite localities.
They often build near the farm-houses, and the nest is rarely more than seven
feet from the ground. The base of the nest is usually a rudely constructed
platform of coarse sticks, often armed with formidable thorns surrounding
the nest with a barricade. The height is usually 5 inches, with a diameter of
8. The cavity is 3 inches deep and 5 wide. Within the external barricade
is an inner nest constructed of soft fine roots.</p>

<p>The eggs, from four to six in number, vary in length from .94 to 1.06
inches, with a mean length of .99. Their breadth varies from .81 to .69 of
an inch, mean breadth .75. They also exhibit great variations in the combinations
of markings and tints. The ground color is usually light greenish-blue,
varying in the depth of its shade from a very light tint to a distinct
blue, with a slight greenish tinge. The markings consist of yellowish-brown
and purple, chocolate-brown, russet, and a very dark brown.</p>

<p><!--088.png--><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>
<span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Catbird has a very extended geographical range. It is
abundant throughout the Atlantic States, from Florida to Maine; in the
central portion of the continent it is found as far north as Lake Winnepeg.</p>

<p>On the Pacific coast it has been met with at Panama, and also on the
Columbia River. It is occasional in Cuba and the Bahamas, and in the Bermudas
is a permanent resident. It is also found during the winter months
abundant in Central America, It breeds in all the Southern States with
possibly the exception of Florida. In Maine, according to Professor Verrill,
it is as common as in Massachusetts, arriving in the former place about the
20th of May, about a week later than in the vicinity of Boston, and beginning
to deposit its eggs early in June. Near Calais it is a less common
visitant.</p>

<p>The Northern migrations of the Catbird commence early in February,
when they make their appearance in Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas.
In April they reach Virginia and Pennsylvania, and New England from the
1st to the 10th of May. Their first appearance is usually coincident with
the blossoming of the pear-trees. It is not generally a popular or welcome
visitant, a prejudice more or less wide spread existing in regard to it. Yet
few birds more deserve kindness at our hands, or will better repay it. From
its first appearance among us, almost to the time of departure in early
fall, the air is vocal with the quaint but attractive melody, rendered all the
more interesting from the natural song being often blended with notes imperfectly
mimicked from the songs of other birds. The song, whether
natural or imitative, is always varied, attractive, and beautiful.</p>

<p>The Catbird, when once established as a welcome guest, soon makes
itself perfectly at home. He is to be seen at all times, and is almost ever in
motion. They become quite tame, and the male bird will frequently apparently
delight to sing in the immediate presence of man. Occasionally they
will build their nest in close proximity to a house, and appear unmindful of
the presence of the members of the family.</p>

<p>The Catbird’s power of mimicry, though limited and imperfectly exercised,
is frequently very amusing. The more difficult notes it rarely attempts
to copy, and signally fails whenever it does so. The whistle of the Quail,
the cluck of a hen calling her brood, the answer of the young chicks, the
note of the Pewit Flycatcher, and the refrain of Towhee, the Catbird will
imitate with so much exactness as not to be distinguished from the original.</p>

<p>The Catbirds are devoted parents, sitting upon their eggs with great
closeness, feeding the young with assiduity, and accompanying them with
parental interest when they leave the nest, even long after they are able
to provide for themselves. Intruders from whom danger is apprehended
they will boldly attack, attempting to drive away snakes, cats, dogs, and
sometimes even man. If these fail they resort to piteous cries and other
manifestations of their great distress.</p>

<p>Towards each other they are affectionate and devoted, mutually assisting
<!--089.png--><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span>
in the construction of the nest; and as incubation progresses the female, who
rarely leaves the nest, is supplied with food, and entertained from his exhaustless
vocabulary of song, by her mate. When annoyed by an intruder
the cry of the Catbird is loud, harsh, and unpleasant, and is supposed to
resemble the outcry of a cat, and to this it owes its name. This note it
reiterates at the approach of any object of its dislike or fear.</p>

<p>The food of the Catbird is almost exclusively the larvæ of the larger
insects. For these it searches both among the branches and the fallen
leaves, as well as the furrows of newly ploughed fields and cultivated gardens.
The benefit it thus confers upon the farmer and the horticulturist
is very great, and can hardly be overestimated.</p>

<p>The Catbird can with proper painstaking be raised from the nest, and
when this is successfully accomplished they become perfectly domesticated,
and are very amusing pets.</p>

<p>They construct their nests on clusters of vines or low bushes, on the
edges of small thickets, and in retired places, though almost always near
cultivated ground. The usual materials of their nests are dry leaves for the
base, slender strips of long dry bark, small twigs, herbaceous plants, fine
roots, and finer stems. They are lined with fine dry grasses, and sedges.
Their nests average 4 inches in height by 5 in diameter. The diameter and
depth of the cavity are 3½ inches. The eggs are of a uniform deep bluish-green,
and measure .97 in length and .69 of an inch in breadth.</p>

and notched; the commissural edges of the
bill finely nicked towards end. Feet large
and strong, the toes projecting considerably

<p>The slightly upward bend of the
bill, somewhat as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthus</i>, renders
the culmen concave, and the commissure slightly convex. The maxilla at
base is nearly as high as the mandible;
the whole bill is much compressed
and attenuated. The lateral
claws barely reach the base of
the middle one, which is broad;
the inner face extended into a
horny lamina, with one or two
notches or pectinations somewhat
as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caprimulgidæ</i>. The stiffened
sub-falcate wings are quite remarkable.
The tail is so short that
the upper coverts extend nearly to
its tip.</p>

<p>The species are all dull-colored birds, usually brown, sometimes varied
with white on the head, back, or throat. They inhabit mountainous subalpine
regions abounding in rapid streams, and always attract attention
by their habit of feeding under water, searching among the gravel and
stones for their insect prey.</p>

<p class="small">Specimens, of any age, from the coast of Oregon and the Cascade Mountains, have the
head more deeply brownish than those from other regions.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Found through the mountainous region of the central and western part of North
America, from Fort Halkett south into Mexico and Guatemala. Orizaba (Alpine region)
<span class="sc">Sumich.</span> None received from the coast region of California. Abundant on the N. W.
coast, Laramie Peak and Deer Creek, Neb.</p>

<p>This species has a wide range along the mountainous region of North and
Middle America. Mexican specimens are darker.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This interesting bird inhabits exclusively the mountainous portions
of North America west of the Mississippi from Alaska south to Guatemala.
It does not appear to have been obtained on the coast of California,
nor in the valley of the Mississippi. In the British Possessions specimens
have been procured on Fraser’s River, at Fort Halkett, and at Colville. At
the latter place Mr. J. K. Lord states that a few remain and pass the winter.
They are found among the mountain streams of Vera Cruz, and probably
throughout Mexico, and no doubt may be met with in all the highlands
between these extreme points. Dr. Newberry met with it in the rapid
streams of the Cascade Mountains. He describes it as flitting along in the
bed of the stream, from time to time plunging into the water and disappearing,
to appear again at a distant point, up or down the stream, skipping
about from stone to stone, constantly in motion, jerking its tail and moving
its body somewhat in the manner of a wren.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper observed this species both on the Columbia and its tributaries,
and also among the mountain streams of the Coast Range west of Santa
Clara. At the latter place he found a pair mated as early as March 16th.
At sunset he heard the male singing very melodiously, as it sat on one
of its favorite rocks in the middle of the foaming rapids, making its delightful
melody heard for quite a long distance above the sound of the roaring
waters.</p>

<p>“This bird,” adds Dr. Cooper, “combines the form of a sandpiper, the song
of a canary, and the aquatic habits of a duck. Its food consists almost
entirely of aquatic insects, and these it pursues under water, walking and
flying with perfect ease beneath a depth of several feet of water.” He also
states that they do not swim on the surface, but dive, and sometimes fly
across streams beneath the surface; that their flight is rapid and direct, like
that of a sandpiper; also that they jerk their tails in a similar manner, and
generally alight on a rock or log.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper on the 5th of July found a nest of this bird at a saw-mill on
the Chehalis River, built under the shelving roots of an enormous arbor-vitæ
that had floated over, and rested in a slanting position against the dam. The
floor was of small twigs, the sides and roof arched over it like an oven, and
formed of moss, projecting so as to protect and shelter the opening, which
was large enough to admit the hand. Within this nest was a brood of half-fledged
young. The parents were familiar and fearless, and had become
<!--095.png--><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span>
accustomed to the society of the millers. They had previously raised another
brood that season.</p>

<p>The same observant naturalist, some time afterwards, in May, found the
nest of another pair, a few miles north of Santa Clara. This was built near
the foot of a mill-dam, resting on a slight ledge under an overhanging rock,
from which water was continually dropping. It was, in shape, like an oven,
with a small doorway, and it was built externally of green moss, which, being
still living, prevented the easy discovery of the nest. It was lined with soft
grass, and contained young.</p>

<p>These birds are found singly or in pairs, and never more than two together.
They are never found near still water, and frequent only wild mountain-streams,
cascades, eddies, and swift currents.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Dall’s observations in Alaska, the species is essentially
solitary. He obtained several specimens in January, February, and March,
always near some open, unfrozen spots in the Nulato River. It was only
found in the most retired spots, and almost invariably alone. When disturbed,
it would dive into the water, even in midwinter.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway describes the Dipper as remarkably quick, as well as odd, in
its movements,&mdash;whether walking in the shallow bed of the stream, or
standing on a stone along the edge, continually tilting up and down, now
chattering as it flies rapidly along the stream, again alighting into the water,
in which it wades with the greatest facility. Its flight is remarkably swift
and well sustained, and in manner is very unusual, the bird propelling itself
by a rapid buzzing of the wings, following in its flight every undulation in
the course of the stream into which it drops suddenly. Its song is described
as remarkably sweet and lively, in modulation resembling somewhat that of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Harporhynchus rufus</i>, but less powerful, though sweeter in effect.</p>

<p>Dr. E. Baldamus, of Halle, who possesses specimens of the eggs of this
species, describes them as pure white in color, oval in shape, and hardly
distinguishable from those of the European <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. aquaticus</i>.</p>

<p>A nest of this bird obtained by Mr. J. Stevenson, of Hayden’s Expedition,
in Berthoud’s Pass, Colorado, is a hemisphere of very uniform contour built
on a rock, on the edge of a stream. Externally it was composed of green
moss, in a living state; within is a strong, compactly built apartment,
arched over, and supported by twigs, with a cup-like depression at the bottom,
hemispherical and composed of roots and twigs firmly bound together.
The structure is 7 inches in height externally, and has a diameter of 10½
inches at the base. Within, the cavity has a depth of 6 inches; the
entrance, which is on one side, is 3½ in breadth by 2½ in height. The eggs
were three in number, uniform, dull white, and unspotted. They measure
1.04 inches by .70. They have an elongated oval shape, and are much
pointed at one end.</p>

An Old World species (Europe, Northern Africa, and Asia), abundant in Greenland,

States: Long Island.</p>

<p>This bird appears to be abundant in Norton Sound, from which region Mr.
Dall has recently brought specimens in full spring plumage. These are decidedly
smaller than birds
from Labrador and Greenland,
but not distinguishable,
and seem to agree precisely
with skins from Central Europe.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The well-known
Wheat-ear is entitled to a
place in our fauna, not only
as an accidental visitor, but
also as an occasional resident.
Dr. H. R. Storer, of
Boston, found them breeding
in Labrador in the summer
of 1848, and procured specimens
of the young birds
which were fully identified
by Dr. Samuel Cabot as belonging to this species. In the following year
Andrew Downs, of Halifax, gave me the specimen described and figured
<!--098.png--><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span>
by Mr. Cassin. This was secured late in the summer near Cape Harrison,
Labrador, where it had evidently just reared its brood. In 1860 Mr. Elliott
Coues obtained another specimen on the 25th of August, at Henley Harbor.
It was in company with two others, and was in immature plumage. Its
occurrence in considerable numbers on the coast of Labrador is further confirmed
by a writer (“W. C.”) in “The Field,” for June 10, 1871, who states
that when in that region during the months of May and June he saw a
number of “White Ears,” the greater proportion of them being males. He
inferred from this that they breed in that country, the apparent scarcity
of females being due to their occupation in nesting. Mr. Lawrence has one
in his cabinet from Long Island, and the Smithsonian Institution one from
Quebec. Specimens have also been obtained in the Bermudas.</p>

<p>Holböll, in his paper on the fauna of Greenland, is of the opinion that the
individuals of this species that occur there come from Europe, make their
journey across the Atlantic without touching at Iceland, and arrive in
South Greenland as early in the season as it does at the former place, the first
of May. It reaches Godhaven a month later, at times when all is snowbound
and the warmth has not yet released the insects on which it feeds.
It is found as far north as the <abbr title="seventy-third">73d</abbr> parallel, and even beyond. In September
it puts on its winter dress and departs.</p>

<p>Mr. Dall states that several large flocks of this species were seen at Nulato,
May 23 and 24, 1868, and a number of specimens obtained. They were
said to be abundant on the dry stony hill-tops, but were rare along the
river.</p>

<p>The Wheat-ear is one of the most common birds of Europe, and is found,
at different seasons, throughout that continent as well as in a large portion
of Western Asia. It breeds throughout the British Islands as well as in the
whole of Northern Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>Its food is principally worms and insects, the latter of which it takes upon
the wing, in the manner of a fly-catcher. The male bird is said to sing
prettily, but not loudly, warbling even when on the wing, and hovering
over its nest or over its partner. In confinement its song is continued by
night as well as by day.</p>

<p>The Wheat-ear begins to make its nest in April, usually concealing it in
some deep recess beneath a huge stone, and often far beyond the reach of
the arm. Sometimes it is placed in old walls, and is usually large and
rudely constructed, made of dried bents, scraps of shreds, feathers, and
rubbish collected about the huts, generally containing four pale blue eggs,
uniform in color, and without spots, which measure .81 of an inch in length
by .69 in breadth.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Bluebird is abundant throughout the eastern portion of
North America, breeding in nearly
every part, from Georgia and Louisiana
to the Arctic regions, with only
this exception, that near the seaboard
its migrations do not extend
so far to the north as in the interior.
It is very rarely to be met with beyond
the Penobscot, although Professor
Verrill mentions it as very
common in the western part of Maine.
It is found throughout the year in the
Bermudas, and occasionally in Cuba.
The Selkirk Settlement is the most northern locality to which it has been
traced. It is not known to occur farther west than the highlands west of
the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Through all the Eastern States the Bluebird is one of the most familiar
and welcome of the earliest visitors of spring, usually making its appearance
as early as the first of March. In mild seasons they come in the latter
part of February, long before there is any apparent relaxation of the severity
of winter. In 1857, in consequence of the unusual mildness of the season,
Bluebirds appeared in large numbers as early as the 15th of February,
and remained apparently without suffering any inconvenience, although the
weather subsequently became quite severe. In 1869 their first appearance
was observed as early as the 28th of January, the earliest period of which
I can find any record.</p>

<p>In the Middle States, with every mild winter’s day, the Bluebirds come
<!--101.png--><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>
out from their retreats, and again disappear on the return of severer weather.
Later in the season, or early in March, they return and make a permanent
stay.</p>

<p>When well treated, as the Bluebirds almost universally are, they return
year after year to the same box, coming always in pairs. The marked attentions
of the male bird are very striking, and have been noticed by all our
writers. He is very jealous of a rival, driving off every intruder of his own
species who ventures upon the domain he calls his own. Occasionally the
pair suffer great annoyance from vexatious interferences with their domestic
arrangements by the house wren, who unceremoniously enters their homestead,
despoils it of its carefully selected materials, and departs. At other
times the wren will take possession of the premises and barricade the entrance,
making the return of its rightful owners impossible.</p>

<p>The song of the Bluebirds is a low warble, soft and agreeable, repeated
with great constancy and earnestness, and prolonged until quite late in the
season. Just before their departure, late in October, the sprightliness of
their song nearly ceases, and only a few plaintive notes are heard instead.</p>

<p>The food of the Bluebird consists principally of the smaller coleopterous
insects, also of the larvæ of the smaller lepidoptera. In the early spring
they are very busy turning over the dry leaves, examining the trunks and
branches of trees, or ransacking posts and fences for the hiding-places of
their prey. In the fall their food partakes more of a vegetable character.</p>

<p>The Bluebird selects as a suitable place for its nest a hollow in the decayed
trunk of a tree, or boxes prepared for its use. Their early arrival
enables them to select their own site. The nest is loosely constructed of
soft materials, such as fine grasses, sedges, leaves, hair, feathers, etc. These
are rarely so well woven together as to bear removal. The eggs are usually
five and sometimes six in number. There are usually three broods in a
season. Before the first brood are able to provide for themselves, the female
repairs her nest and commences incubation for a second family. The young
birds are, however, by no means left to shift for themselves. The male bird
now shows himself as devoted a parent as in the earlier spring he had proved
himself an attentive mate. He watches over the brood even after the second
family appears and claims his attention. We often find him dividing his
cares in the latter part of the season with two broods, and at the same
time supplying his mate with food, and occasionally taking her place on
the nest.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Bluebird are of a uniform pale blue, measuring about .81
of an inch in length by .62 in breadth.</p>

<p>In Guatemala is found a local race differing in its lighter under colors and
in the greenish tinting of its blue (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. azurea</i>). The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. sialis</i> is also found in
the more open districts of the elevated regions where it is numerous. It is
there known as “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">El azulejo</i>.”</p>

<p>As in the others, the colors of this species are much duller in fall and
winter. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 53,319, <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr> (Carson City, Nevada, <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 21) differs from others in
the following respects: there is hardly any chestnut on the back, there being
only just a tinge along each side of the interscapular region; that on the
breast is interrupted in the middle, and thrown into a patch on each side of
the breast, thus connecting the blue of the throat and abdomen; the blue
of the throat is unusually deep.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This Bluebird belongs to western North America, its proper
domain being between the Rocky Mountains and Pacific, from Mexico to
Washington Territory. Mr. Nuttall first met with this species among the
small rocky prairies of the Columbia. He speaks of its habits as exactly
similar to those of the common Bluebird. The male is equally tuneful
throughout the breeding-season, and his song is also very similar. Like the
common species he is very devoted to his mate, alternately feeding and
caressing her and entertaining her with his song. This is a little more
varied, tender, and sweet than that of the Eastern species, and differs in its
expressions.</p>

<p>Nuttall describes this as an exceedingly shy bird, so much so that he
found it very difficult to obtain a sight of it. This he attributes to the
great abundance of birds of prey. Afterwards, in the vicinity of the village
of Santa Barbara, Mr. Nuttall again saw them in considerable numbers,
when they were tame and familiar.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper states that these Bluebirds seem to prefer the knot-holes of
the oaks to the boxes provided for them. He does not confirm Mr. Nuttall’s
description of its song, which he regards as neither so loud nor so sweet as
<!--103.png--><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span>
that of the Eastern species. He describes it as a curious performance, sounding
as if two birds were singing at once and in different keys.</p>

<p>Many of this species remain in Washington Territory during the winter,
where Dr. Cooper met with them in December. They associated in flocks,
frequented roadsides and fences, and fed upon insects and berries.</p>

<p>Dr. Gambel found this species throughout the Rocky Mountains, and always
in company with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sialia arctica</i>, being by far the more abundant species.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly mentions finding this species very abundant during his
march up the Rio Grande. Through the months of November, December,
and January they were always to be seen in large flocks near small streams.</p>

<p>The Western Bluebird constructs a nest usually of very loose materials,
consisting chiefly of fine dry grasses. These are not woven into an elaborate
nest, but are simply used to line the hollows in which the eggs are deposited.
Near San Francisco Mr. Hepburn found a pair making use of the nest of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hirundo lunifrons</i>. On another occasion the Bluebirds had not only taken
possession of the nest of this swallow, but actually covered up two fresh eggs
with a lining of dry grasses, and laid her own above them.</p>

<p>The eggs, usually four in number, are of uniform pale blue of a slightly
deeper shade than that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. sialis</i>. They measure .87 of an inch in
length by .69 in breadth.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper’s subsequent observations of this species in California enabled
him to add to his account of it in his report on the birds of that State. He
found it abundant in all the wooded districts, except high in the mountains,
and thinks they reside through the summer even in the hot valley of the Rio
Grande, where he found them preparing a nest in February. On the coast
they are numerous as far north as the 49th parallel. He found a nest under
the porch of a dwelling-house at Santa Barbara, showing that, like our Eastern
species, they only need a little encouragement to become half domesticated.
They raise two broods in a season, the first being hatched early in April.</p>

<p>At Santa Cruz he found them even more confiding than the Eastern species,
building their nests even in the noisiest streets. One brood came every day
during the grape season, at about noon, to pick up grape-skins thrown out
by his door, and was delightfully tame, sitting fearlessly within a few feet of
the open window.</p>

<p>In regard to their song Mr. Ridgway states that he did not hear, even
during the pairing season, any note approaching in sweetness, or indeed
similar to, the joyous spring warble which justly renders our Eastern Bluebird
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. sialis</i>) so universal a favorite.</p>

<p>The two Western species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sialia</i>, though associating during the winter
in the region along the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada, are seldom seen
together during the breeding-season; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. arctica</i> returning to the higher
portions of the thinly wooded desert mountains, while the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. mexicana</i> remains
in the lower districts, either among the cottonwoods of the river
valleys or among the pines around the foot-hills of the Sierra.</p>

Central table-lands of North America, east to mouth of Yellowstone. One
individual collected at Fort Franklin, Great Bear Lake. Not common on the Pacific
slope; the only specimens received coming from Simiahmoo, Fort Crook, and San Diego.
Not recorded as found in Mexico. W. Arizona, <span class="sc">Coues</span>.</p>

<p>As already stated, the blue of this species is greener, more smalt-like
than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sialis</i>. The females are distinguished from those of the other
species by the greener blue, entire absence of rufous, and longer wings.</p>

<p>In autumn and winter the blue of the male is much soiled by amber-brown
edges to the feathers, this most conspicuous on the breast, where
the blue is sometimes almost concealed; the plumage of the female, too, at
this season is different from that of spring, the anterior lower parts being
soft isabella-color, much less grayish than in spring.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This Bluebird belongs chiefly to the Central fauna, and occupies
a place in the Eastern only by its appearance on its borders. It was first
procured by Sir John Richardson, at Fort Franklin, in July, 1825. It is
abundant throughout the central table-lands of North America, between
the Pacific and the mouth of the Yellowstone, from Great Bear Lake to
the lower portions of California. In the latter State it is not common.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall met with this species in the early part of June, northwest of
Laramie Fork. The female uttered a low complaint when her nest was
approached. This was constructed in a hole in a clay cliff. Another was
found in the trunk of a decayed cedar. In one of these the young were
already hatched. The nest was composed of dried grasses, but in very insignificant
quantity. Mr. Nuttall found them much more shy than the common
species, and describes them as feeding in very nearly the same manner.
He afterwards found a nest of the same species in a cliff of the Sandy
River, a branch of the Colorado. Both parents were feeding their brood.
The female was very uneasy at his approach, chirping, and at intervals
uttering a plaintive cry. He states that the male bird has a more plaintive
<!--105.png--><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>
and monotonous song than that of the common Bluebird, and that it has the
same warbling tone and manner. He afterwards observed the same species
in the winter, at Fort Vancouver, associating with the Western Bluebird.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse found the Arctic Bluebird quite common in the vicinity
of Santa Fé, in New Mexico, where they breed about the houses in boxes put
up for them by the inhabitants for the purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. Townsend found this species in the vicinity of the Platte River, near
the Black Hills, and also on the banks of the Columbia. They confined
themselves to the fences in the neighborhood of settlements, occasionally
lighting upon the ground and scratching for minute insects. He describes
their song as a delightful warble. Its notes resemble those of the common
Bluebird, but are so different as to be easily recognized; they are equally
sweet and clear, but have much less power.</p>

<p>Neither Dr. Gambel nor Dr. Heermann found this species in California
excepting during the winter, and were of the opinion that none remain there
to breed.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly observed them at different points among the Rocky Mountains,
where they frequented the vicinity of his camp early in the morning,
at some times in pairs and at others in flocks of four or five.</p>

<p>Mr. J. K. Lord states that he found this Bluebird very abundant between
the Cascades and the Rocky Mountains, where they arrive in June and leave
in September. After nesting they assembled in large flocks, and fed on the
open plains.</p>

<p>The eggs are of a very light blue, paler than those of the other species.
They measure .89 of an inch in length by .66 in breadth.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway states that he found the Rocky Mountain Bluebird nesting
in Virginia City in June. Its nests were built about the old buildings,
and occasionally in the unused excavations about the mines. At Austin he
also found it common in July, in similar localities. On the East Humboldt
Mountains it was very numerous, especially on the more elevated portions,
where it nested among the rocks and, though more rarely, in the deserted
excavations of woodpeckers in the stunted piñon and cedar trees. He
describes it as generally very shy and difficult to obtain, seldom permitting
a very near approach. In its habits it is much less arboreal than either <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S.
mexicana</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. sialis</i>, always preferring the open mountain portions in the
higher ranges of the Great Basin.</p>

<p>In regard to its notes Mr. Ridgway says: “The common note of this
species would, from its character, be at once recognized as that of a Bluebird.
Its autumnal note, however, lacks entirely the peculiar plaintiveness
so characteristic of that of our Eastern species, and is much more feeble,
consisting of a simple weak <i class="birdcall">chirp</i>. Like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. mexicana</i>, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. arctica</i>
was also never heard to give utterance to anything resembling the lovely
spring warbling of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. sialis</i>.”</p>

Telegraph Expedition, the first known instance of the existence in North
America of a group of birds characteristic of the northern parts of the Old
World. Among the smallest of the class, they are eminently sociable, and
feed entirely on insects, which they capture mostly on the wing, like flycatchers.

<p>For the purpose of distinguishing this genus from any other North
American, it is enough to say that, of the
general appearance of the warblers, it has
a short spurious first primary, as in the
Thrushes, and some <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireonidæ</i>. The single
species found as yet within our limits resembles
at first sight an immature <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroica

wing formula, the yellowish stripe over the
eye, and the brown tail-feathers.</p>

(Description of specimen <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 45,909.) Plumage in August: above olive-green,
with a slight shade of brown on top of head, rather lighter behind; beneath white,
tinged with greenish-yellow; more olive on the throat and breast; and more yellow
behind, inside the wing and on thighs; axillars purer yellow. A well-marked greenish-yellow
line from nostrils over the eye to the nape (extending behind the eye nearly as
far as from eye to tip of bill), beneath this an olivaceous streak through the eye, running
into the mixed olive and yellowish of the cheeks. Quills and tail-feathers brown, edged
with olivaceous; the outer edges of primaries more yellowish than those of secondaries;
the greater coverts tipped externally with greenish-yellow, so as to form a distinct band
<!--108.png--><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>
across the wing. Bill rather dark brown; paler beneath. Legs dark olive; toes not sensibly
different. Nest probably on ground, and domed. Eggs white, spotted with pink.</p>

<p class="small">Spurious quill in length about one fourth the second, which about equals the sixth, or
very slightly exceeds it; third and fourth longest; fifth a little shorter.</p>

<p class="small">Dimensions (fresh specimen before being skinned): total length, 4.75; expanse of
wings, 6.00; wing from carpal joint, 2.50.</p>

<p class="small">Dimensions (prepared specimen): total length, 4.60; wing, 2.40; tail, 2.00. Exposed
portion of first primary, 0.42; of second, 1.56; of longest (measured from exposed base
of first primary), 1.85. Bill: length from above, 0.38; from nostril, 0.29; along gape,
1.55. Legs: tarsus, 0.66; middle toe and claw, 0.55; claw alone, 0.16; hind toe and
claw, 0.36; claw alone, 0.20.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Northeast Asia (China, East Siberia); adjacent to Behring’s Straits and Alaska.</p>

<p>This species, in general appearance, apparently comes nearer to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. trochilus</i>
than to any other of its congeners. It is, however, more olivaceous-green
above, and more yellow beneath, and has a distinct band across the wing.
The superciliary light stripe is more distinct and longer; the bill and legs
are darker, and the toes not sensibly different in color from the tarsus. The
proportion of the quills is much the same, except that the interval between
the tips of the fifth and sixth quills is greater, and the second is almost inappreciably
longer than the latter, not reaching nearly midway between the
two. The first or spurious quill is rather shorter.</p>

<p>A single specimen of this species was obtained August 16, 1866, on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael’s Island, in Norton Sound, Alaska, by Mr. Charles Pease. Mr.
Bannister met with no other specimen in that locality, and from this it is
inferred that this is not an abundant species there. It was described as a
new species under the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. kennicottii</i> (Baird), but has been ascertained
by Mr. Tristram, to whom it was sent for examination, (Ibis, 1871,
p. 231,) to be identical with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. borcalis</i> of Blasius.</p>

<p>Dr. Blasius also states (Naumannia, 1858, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 303) that a specimen of this
species has been obtained on the island of Heligoland, showing it to be also
an accidental visitant to Western Europe.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Mr. R. Swinhoe, who describes this among the birds of Formosa
as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. sylvicultrix</i>, states it to be a summer visitant to Southern China, passing
in large numbers through Amoy in its autumnal migrations southeastward,
probably to the Philippine Islands, touching at Southwestern Formosa and
Twaiwanfoo, where he found them abundant. This was for a few days in
October, but he neither saw any before nor afterwards, nor did he meet with
any at Tamsuy (Ibis, 1863, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 307). The same writer (Ibis, 1860, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 53)
speaks of this bird as very abundant in Amoy during the months of April
and May, but passing farther north to breed.</p>

<p>We have no information in reference to its habits, and nothing farther in
regard to its distribution. As it bears a very close resemblance to the Willow
Wren of Europe, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. trochilus</i>, it is quite probable that its general habits,
nest, and eggs will be found to correspond very closely with those of that
bird.</p>

<p><!--109.png--><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span>
The European warblers of the genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phyllopneuste</i> are all insect-eating
birds, capturing their prey while on the wing, and also feeding on their
larvæ. They frequent the woodlands during their breeding-season, but at
all other times are much more familiar, keeping about dwellings and sheepfolds.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. trochilus</i> is a resident throughout the entire year in Southern
Europe and in Central Asia. That species builds at the foot of a bush on
the ground, and constructs a domed nest with the entrance on one side.
Their eggs are five in number, have a pinkish-white ground, and are spotted
with well-defined blotches of reddish-brown, measuring 0.65 by 0.50 inch,
and are of a rounded oval shape.</p>

<p>Specimens of this bird from the far West
are much brighter and more olivaceous above;
the markings of the face are also somewhat
different in showing less dusky about the eye.
These may form a variety <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">olivaceus</i>.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Regulus cristatus</i> of Europe, a close ally
of our bird, is distinguished by having shorter
wings and longer bill; the flame-color of the
head is more extended, the black border is
almost wanting anteriorly. The back and rump, too, are more yellow.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Golden-crested Kinglet, or Wren, as it is often called, occurs
over nearly the whole of the North American continent. It is abundant
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and throughout the British Provinces, where
<!--111.png--><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span>
it chiefly occurs in its breeding-season. In Massachusetts it is a winter
resident from October until May. In Maine it is met with in spring and
fall, chiefly as a migratory visitor; a few also remain, and probably breed, in
the dense <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thuja</i> swamps of that State. They are most abundant in April,
and again in October. In the vicinity of Calais the Golden-crest is a common
summer resident, and, without doubt, breeds there.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse mentions finding this species in abundance in New Mexico
and Texas, associated with Nuthatches and Titmice. Dr. Cooper found it
abundant in Washington Territory, particularly in the winter, and ascertained
positively that they breed there, by seeing them feeding their young near
Puget Sound, in the month of August. According to Mr. Ridgway it is
much less numerous in the Great Basin than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">R. calendula</i>.</p>

<p>The food of this lively and attractive little bird during the summer months
is almost exclusively the smaller winged insects, which it industriously pursues
amid the highest tree-tops of the forest. At other seasons its habits
are more those of the titmice, necessity leading it to ransack the crevices of
the bark on the trunks and larger limbs of the forest-trees. It is an expert
fly-catcher, taking insects readily upon the wing.</p>

<p>But little is known with certainty regarding its breeding-habits, and its
nest and eggs have not yet been described. The presumption, however, is
that it builds a pensile nest, not unlike the European congener, and lays
small eggs finely sprinkled with buff-colored dots on a white ground, and in
size nearly corresponding with those of our common Humming-Bird. We
must infer that it raises two broods in a season, from the fact that it spends
so long a period, from April to October, in its summer abode, and still more
because while Mr. Nuttall found them feeding their full-fledged young in
May, on the Columbia, Dr. Cooper, in the same locality, and Mr. Audubon,
in Labrador, observed them doing the same thing in the month of August.</p>

<p>According to the observations of Mr. J. K. Lord, this species is very common
on Vancouver’s Island and along the entire boundary line separating
Washington Territory from British Columbia, where he met with them at an
altitude of six thousand feet. He states that they build a pensile nest suspended
from the extreme end of a pine branch, and that they lay from five
to seven eggs. These he does not describe.</p>

<p>Most writers speak of this Kinglet as having no song, its only note
being a single chirp. But in this they are certainly greatly in error. Without
having so loud or so powerful a note as the Ruby-crown (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">R. calendula</i>),
for its song will admit of no comparison with the wonderful vocal powers
of that species, it yet has a quite distinctive and prolonged succession
of pleasing notes, which I have heard it pour forth in the midst of the
most inclement weather in February almost uninterruptedly, and for quite
an interval.</p>

<p>Bischoff obtained a large number of this species at Kodiak, and also at
Sitka, where it seemed to replace the Ruby-crown.</p>

overlies and conceals the nostrils, which was probably the reason with Cabanis
and Blyth for placing it in a different genus. There is no other very apparent

between young specimens of the two species.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Much yet remains to be learned as to the general habits, the
<!--113.png--><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span>
nesting, and distribution during the breeding-season of the Ruby-crowned
Kinglet. It is found, at varying periods, in all parts of North America,
from Mexico to the shores of the Arctic seas, and from the Atlantic to the
Pacific; and, although its breeding-places are not known, its occurrence in
the more northern latitudes, from Maine to the extreme portions of the continent,
during the season of reproduction, indicate pretty certainly its extended
distribution throughout all the forests from the 44th parallel northward.
None of our American ornithologists are known to have met with either its
eggs or its nest, but we may reasonably infer that its nest is pensile, like
that of its European kindred, and from being suspended from the higher
branches, from its peculiar structure and position has thus far escaped
observation.</p>

<p>In the New England States they are most abundant in the months of
October and April. A few probably remain in the thick evergreen woods
throughout the winter, and in the northern parts of Maine they are occasionally
found in the summer, and, without doubt, breed there. In the damp
swampy woods of the islands in the Bay of Fundy, the writer heard their
remarkable song resounding in all directions throughout the month of June.</p>

<p>The song of this bird is by far the most remarkable of its specific peculiarities.
Its notes are clear, resonant, and high, and constitute a prolonged
series, varying from the lowest tones to the highest, terminating with the
latter. It may be heard at quite a distance, and in some respects bears
more resemblance to the song of the English Skylark than to that of the
Canary, to which Mr. Audubon compares it.</p>

<p>Their food appears to be chiefly the smaller insects, in pursuit of which
they are very active, and at times appear to be so absorbed in their avocation
as to be unmindful of the near presence of the sportsman or collector, and
unwarned by the sound of the deadly gun. They are also said by Wilson
to feed upon the stamens of the blossoms of the maple, the apple, peach, and
other trees. Like the other species, they are expert insect-takers, catching
them readily on the wing. They are chiefly to be met with in the spring
among the tree-tops, where the insects they prefer abound among the
expanding buds. In the fall of the year, on their return, they are more
commonly met with among lower branches, and among bushes near the
ground.</p>

<p>Although presumed to be chiefly resident, during the summer months,
of high northern regions, Wilson met with specimens in Pennsylvania
during the breeding-season; and it is quite probable that they may occur,
here and there, among the high valleys in the midst of mountain ranges,
in different parts of the country.</p>

<p>In the winter it is most abundant in the Gulf States, and especially in
that of Louisiana. Dr. Woodhouse found it quite abundant throughout
Texas, New Mexico, and the Indian Territory. Dr. Cooper found it in
Washington Territory, but did not there meet with it in summer. Dr.
<!--114.png--><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span>
Suckley, however, regarded it as a transient visitor, rather than a winter resident
of that region, and far more abundant from about the 8th of April to
the 20th of May, when it seemed to be migrating, than at any other time.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly found these birds in abundance near Espia, Mexico, and
afterwards, during January, among the Aztec Mountains, and again, in
February, along the Bill Williams Fork. He describes them as lively,
active, and busy in the pursuit of their insect food. They seem to be
equally abundant at this season in California, Arizona, and Colorado.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found them common in June and July among the coniferous
woods high upon the Wahsatch Mountains in Utah, and has no doubt that
they breed there.</p>

<p>Mr. Dall found this species abundant at Nulato, Alaska, in the spring
of 1868, preferring the thickets and alder-bushes away from the river-bank.
They appeared very courageous. A pair that seemed about to commence
building a nest in a small clump of bushes tore to pieces one half finished,
belonging to a pair of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scolecophagus ferrugineus</i>, and, on the blackbirds’
return, attacked the female and drove her away. This was early in June,
and Mr. Dall was compelled to leave without being able to witness the
sequel of the contest.</p>

<p>A straggling specimen of this bird was taken in 1860 at Nenortatik, in
Greenland, and sent in the flesh to Copenhagen.</p>

<p>Near Washington, Dr. Coues states the Blue-gray Gnatcatcher to be a
summer resident, arriving during the first week of April, and remaining
until the latter part of September, during which
time they are very abundant. They are said
to breed in high open woods, and, on their first
arrival, to frequent tall trees on the sides of
streams and in orchards.</p>

<p>In California and Arizona this species occurs,
but is, to some extent, replaced by a smaller
species, peculiarly western, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. melanura</i>. There
they seem to keep more about low bushes, hunting
minute insects in small companies or in
pairs, and their habits are hardly distinguishable
from those of Warblers in most respects.</p>

<p>The food of this species is chiefly small winged insects and their larvæ.
It is an expert insect-catcher, taking its prey on the wing with great
celerity. All its movements are very rapid, the bird seeming to be constantly
in motion as if ever in quest of insects, moving from one part of
the tree to the other, but generally preferring the upper branches.</p>

<p>Nuttall and Audubon, copying Wilson, speak of the nest of this Gnatcatcher
as a very frail receptacle for its eggs, and as hardly strong enough to
bear the weight of the parent bird. This, however, all my observations
attest to be not the fact. The nest is, on the contrary, very elaborately and
carefully constructed; large for the size of the bird, remarkably deep, and
with thick, warm walls composed of soft and downy materials, but abundantly
strong for its builder, who is one of our smallest birds both in size
and in weight. Like the nests of the Wood Pewee and the Humming-Bird,
they are models of architectural beauty and ingenious design. With walls
made of a soft felted material, they are deep and purse-like. They are not
pensile, but are woven to small upright twigs, usually near the tree-top, and
sway with each breeze, but the depth of the cavity and its small diameter
prevent the eggs from rolling out. Externally the nest is covered with a
beautiful periphery of gray lichens, assimilating it to the bark of the deciduous
trees in which it is constructed.</p>

<p>Occasionally these nests have been found at the height of ten feet from
the ground, but they are more frequently built at a much greater elevation,
even to the height of fifty feet or more. They are made in the shape
of a truncated cone, three inches in diameter at the base and but two at the
top, and three and a half inches in height. The diameter of the opening
is an inch and a half. In Northern Georgia they nest about the middle
of May, and are so abundant that the late Dr. Gerhardt would often find
<!--117.png--><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span>
not less than five in a single day, and very rarely were any of them less
than sixty feet from the ground. Dr. Gerhardt, who was an accurate and
careful observer, speaks of these as the best built nests he had met with in
this country, both in regard to strength and its ingeniously contrived aperture,
so narrowed at the top that it is impossible for the eggs to roll out even
in the severest wind. They have two broods in the season in the Southern
States, one in April and again in July.</p>

<p>This Flycatcher lays usually five eggs. These are of a short oval form,
somewhat pointed at one end and rounded at the other, and measure .56
of an inch in length by .44 in breadth. Their ground-color is a greenish-white,
marked and dotted with small blotches and spots of varying and
blending shades of reddish-brown, lilac, and slate.</p>

bar, not reaching the bill, whereas in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cærulea</i> it not only reaches the bill,
but also extends across the forehead; the light superciliary stripe is more
distinct. The tail is entirely different, the lateral feathers being almost
entirely black, instead of the reverse.</p>

<p>From immature specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. melanura</i> it may be distinguished by
larger size and purer white lower parts, and greater amount of white on
outer webs of lateral tail-feathers.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> But little is known in regard to the distribution or history of
this species. It appears to be peculiar to Arizona and Mexico. There is no
good reason to suppose that it differs materially in any of its habits from
the other species of this genus. Dr. Cooper, who observed this species at
Fort Mojave, states that it is a winter resident of that region in small
numbers; and, so far as he observed, is undistinguishable either in habit or
general appearance from either of the other species which at that season
are also found there. Its cry of alarm resembles that of the common wren.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Specific Characters"><span class="sc">Sp. Char.</span></abbr>
Above plumbeous-blue. Whole crown, to bill and eyes, with tail, lustrous
blue-black. Beneath pale bluish-gray, almost white on chin and anal region; the flanks
and crissum tinged with brown. Edge of eyelids, and margin and tip of outer web of
first and second lateral tail-feathers, white. Female and young without the black of the
crown. Length, 4.15; wing, 1.85; tail, 2.10.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
San Diego to Fort Yuma and Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas. Arizona, <span class="sc">Coues</span>.</p>

<p>Specimens of this species from Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas differ from those of San
Diego described in the <abbr  title="Pacific Railroad Routes">P. R. R.</abbr> Report (7,191) in having the whole of the
outer web of the outer tail-feather white, and in a rather larger white tip.
The colors beneath are a little less ashy, though not of a pure white. The
ash of the back is rather lighter and purer. The lores are rather lighter.
The first primary is a little larger and broader.</p>

<p>It is possible that the restriction of the white of the outer web of the
exterior tail-feather to the outer half only is an unusual circumstance, as
both Mr. Cassin and Mr. Lawrence, in their descriptions, speak of the entire
outer web being white,&mdash;the second feather being of the former character.
Under these circumstances there will be little specific difference between
the tails of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. melanura</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plumbea</i>. The female birds will then be
separated by the light superciliary line and much shorter tarsi of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.
plumbea</i>,&mdash;the latter measuring .63 instead of nearly .70 of an inch.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species was first noticed as belonging to the North
American fauna by Captain McCown, who obtained it near Ringgold Barracks
in 1850. It has since been noticed at Fort Yuma and at San Diego,
and obtained in greater abundance at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas. It is also found in
Mexico. Dr. Cooper says that it is common all winter both at San Diego
and at Fort Mohave. It has been traced as far north as latitude 30<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> in the
Sierra Nevada. Its song he describes as a harsh ditty of five parts, something
like a wren’s song, with notes like those of a swallow, and also closely
resembling the song of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireo belli</i>. Their scolding note is a faint mew, like
that of a cat.</p>

<p>The habits of this species appear to be not unlike those of the peculiar
family to which it belongs. All its members are among our smallest birds,
are almost exclusively inhabitants of woods, and resemble the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Reguli</i> in
their restless activity in pursuit of the smallest insects on which they feed.
This bird is described as particularly active, quick in its movements, searching
<!--119.png--><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 82]</span>
with great activity for its food, and preferring low trees and bushes.
At times it will dart about in the air in pursuit of small insects.</p>

<p>Mr. John Xantus found these birds to be quite abundant at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas,
and obtained several of their nests. They were generally built among the
interlacing tendrils of a wild vine (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antigonon leptopus</i>), and so closely interwoven
with the smaller branches as to be inseparable. The nests, like those
of all this family, are structures of great beauty and delicacy. They have a
height and an external diameter of about 2¼ inches. The cavity is 1½ inches
wide at the rim, and fully two inches deep. This great proportionate depth
of the nest seems to be characteristic of this genus. The external portion of
this nest is composed of a composite blending of various vegetable materials,
fine hempen fibres of plants, strips of delicate bark from smaller shrubs,
silken fragments of cocoons and downy cotton-like substance, all very
closely impacted and felted together, somewhat after the manner of the
Humming-Bird. The whole is very softly and warmly lined with a beautifully
interwoven and silky fabric composed of the soft down of various
plants.</p>

<p>The walls of the nest, though of the softest materials, are so thick and
so firmly impacted as to make it a structure remarkably firm and secure
against accidents.</p>

<p>The eggs, four in number, measure .55 of an inch in length by .45 in
breadth. They are of an oblong-oval shape, their ground-color is a pale
greenish-white sprinkled over the entire surface with fine dottings of purple,
reddish-brown, and black.</p>

<p>We have found it impossible to assign the genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chamæa</i> to any recognized
family of American birds, and have accordingly been obliged to give it
independent rank in this respect,
although it may properly
belong to some Old
World group with which we
are not acquainted. In its
general appearance it approaches
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paridæ</i> in loose
plumage, bristly lores, want
of notch to bill, etc.; but
differs in the very much
bristled rictus, sharp-ridged
culmen, linear nostrils, booted tarsi, less amount of adhesion of the toes, etc.
It approaches the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylviidæ</i> in the
sharp-ridged culmen and bristly gape,
but is otherwise very different. The
excessively rounded wing is a peculiar
feature, the sixth primary being
the longest.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Coast region of California.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This very interesting species, which seems to combine within
itself the principal characteristics of the Wren and the Titmouse, was first
described by the late Dr. Gambel of Philadelphia. So far as is now known,
it is confined to the coast country of California, from Fort Tejon to the shore
and from San Diego to the Sacramento. Dr. Gambel’s attention was first
directed to it by the continued sound of a loud, crepitant, grating scold which
he was constantly hearing in fields of dead mustard-stalks and other similar
places. He at last discovered it to be this species, which from its peculiar
habits he called a Wren-tit. It kept close to the ground, was difficult to be
seen, and eluded pursuit by diving into the thickest bunches of weeds, uttering,
when approached, its peculiar grating wren-like notes. When quietly
watched it could be seen to search for insects, climbing twigs and dry stalks
sideways, jerking its long tail, or holding it erect in the manner of a wren,
which, in this position, it very much resembles. He describes it as at times
uttering a slow, monotonous singing note like a chick-a-dee, represented by
<i class="birdcall">pee-pee-pee-peep</i>. At other times its song is a varied succession of whistling.
In spring it was heard, in pairs, calling and answering, in a less solemn
strain, and in a manner not unlike a sparrow, with a brief <i class="birdcall">pit-pit-pit</i>, ending
with a prolonged trill. If disturbed, they at once resumed their usual scolding
cries.</p>

<p>Mr. Bell found this species chiefly frequenting damp places, and speaks
of it as of pert habit, and not easily frightened. Its white iris, when observed
in its native retreats, makes it easily recognized. This feature is as
conspicuous in this bird as it is in the White-eyed Vireo. Its skin is remarkably
strong, the muscles of the thighs powerful and well developed,
and its whole muscular system exhibits an unusual strength and firmness.</p>

<p><!--122.png--><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span>
Dr. Cooper’s observations in regard to this bird are a little different in
some respects. He found it common everywhere west of the Sierra Nevada
on dry plains and hillsides, among the shrubby undergrowth, but not in the
forests. Instead of preferring damp places, he found it living where there is
no water, except occasional fogs, for six or eight months at a time. Their
movements can be observed by patient watching and keeping perfectly
quiet, when they seem attracted by curiosity to such a degree as to approach
one within a few feet, and fearlessly hop round him as if fascinated.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found their nests near San Diego built about three feet from
the ground in low shrubs. They were composed of straw and twigs mixed
with feathers and firmly interwoven. The cavity, about two inches wide
and an inch and three fourths deep, is lined with grass and hair. The eggs,
three or four in number, are of a pale greenish-blue, and measure .70 by .52
of an inch.</p>

<h2><span class="sc">Family</span> <b class="birdname">PARIDÆ</b>.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Titmice.</span></h2>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Characteristics"><span class="sc">Char.</span></abbr> Bill generally short, conical, not notched nor decurved at tip. Culmen broad
and rounded, not sharp-ridged at base. Nostrils rounded, basal, and concealed by dense
bristles or bristly feathers. Loral feathers rough and bristly, directed forwards. Tarsi
distinctly scutellate; basal joints of anterior toes abbreviated, that of middle toe united
about equally for three fourths its length to the lateral: in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parinæ</i> forming a kind of palm
for grasping; outer lateral toe decidedly longer than the inner. Primaries ten, the first
much shorter than the second. Tail-feathers with soft tips. Nest in holes of trees; eggs
white, spotted with reddish.</p>

<p>With Cabanis we include the Nuthatches in the same family with the
Titmice, and have prepared the above diagnosis to embrace both groups.
They agree in having a conical bill, not notched nor decurved, with much
rounded culmen, and nearly straight commissure, and rounded nostrils covered
with dense bristles. These characters will readily distinguish them, in
connection with the ten primaries, and tarsi with scutellæ on the anterior
half only (as compared with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alaudidæ</i>), from any other American <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oscines</i>.</p>

<p>The two subfamilies may be thus distinguished:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="hanging"><b class="birdname">Parinæ.</b> Body compressed. Bill shorter than the head. Wings rounded, equal to or
shorter than the rounded tail. Second quill as short as the tenth. Tarsus longer than

into a palm. Plumage rather soft and lax.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b class="birdname">Sittinæ.</b> Body depressed. Bill about equal to or longer than the head. Wings much
pointed, much longer than the nearly even tail. Tarsus shorter than the middle toe

lead-color.</p>

<p>Specimens from the West are larger, the colors all more strongly
marked.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Tufted Titmouse is a common and well-known species in
the Southern States, from the seaboard to the Rocky Mountains. Its northern
limits are in Pennsylvania, Missouri, and Kansas. Farther north than
this its occurrence appears to be only occasional and accidental. The statement
of Mr. Audubon that they are found in the Northern States, even to
Nova Scotia, was evidently a mistake. They do not occur in Massachusetts,
nor, so far as I am aware, have they been met with in any part of New
England.</p>

<p>They are abundant in Northern Georgia, where, according to the observations
of Dr. Gerhardt, they are among the first birds to breed, having
fledglings fully grown as early as the first of May. Dr. Woodhouse found
them very common in the Indian Territory, but none of the other exploring
parties met with it farther west, where it is replaced by its kindred
species.</p>

<p>It is perhaps the most abundant bird in Southern Illinois, where it is resident,
being excessively numerous in winter, and in that season often a positive
nuisance from their impertinent vehement scolding as they appear to
follow the hunter in troops through the woods. In winter it is a constant
inhabitant of the door-yards and shrubbery, particularly fruit-trees in the
towns, where it is associated with the Carolina Chickadee (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parus carolinensis</i>)
and other winter birds, but exceeding them all in familiarity and
boldness. (Ridgway.)</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall, who never met with this bird north of Pennsylvania, found
it very common in the winter and spring in the Southern States, where it
displayed all the habits and uttered the usual notes of the family. In the
<!--128.png--><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>
dreariest solitudes of the Southern States these birds were his constant and
amusing companions. Their sprightly movements and their varied musical
talents made it even more peculiarly interesting at a time when all the other
tenants of the forest were silent. The notes of this bird, which, when expressed
by this writer on paper, seem only quaint and eccentric articulations,
were characterized by him as lively, cheering, and varied, delivered with a
delicacy, energy, pathos, and variety of expression to which it was far beyond
the power of description to do justice.</p>

<p>These notes, at times, even partook of the high-echoing and clear tones
of the Oriole. The usual song of this Titmouse is presented by Mr. Nuttall
by the following characteristics: “<i class="birdcall">Whip-tom-killy-killy-dāy-dāy-dā-it-tshica-dēē-dee</i>,”
varied with “<i class="birdcall">Kāī-tee-did-did-did</i>,” etc., etc. Later in the season,
under the milder influences of spring, these Titmice pursued the insects from
branch to branch, calling restlessly and with loud and echoing voices, <i class="birdcall">peto-peto-peto</i>,
with frequent quaint variations too numerous to be repeated.
Their song even consisted of successions of playful, pathetic, or querulous
calls, never exhibiting any trills after the manner of the Warblers, yet the
compass and tones of their voice, their capricious variety, and their general
effect are described as quite as pleasing as the more exquisite notes of our
summer songsters.</p>

<p>When wounded this Titmouse resists with great spirit any attempt to take
him alive, but soon becomes tame and familiar in confinement, subsisting on
seeds, broken nuts, etc. Impatient of restraint, it incessantly attempts to
work its way out of its cage.</p>

<p>The general habits of these birds correspond closely with those of the large
family to which they belong. They move usually in small flocks of from
five to ten through the branches of trees and bushes in quest of insects,
examine the cracks and crevices of the bark, hang on the under side of small
branches, move sideways around the trunks of trees, probe the openings in
acorns, pine-cones, nuts, etc., for its food, and retain apparently the family
group until the spring, when they separate into pairs.</p>

<p>One of these birds kept in confinement by Dr. Bachman of Charleston
was in the habit of hiding its food in the corner of its cage, in a small
crevice, and of creeping at night into a small box, where it lay doubled up
like a ball till the first light of the morning, when it resumed its restless
habits.</p>

<p>The Tufted Titmouse passes its nights and days, when the weather is inclement,
in the hollows of decayed trees or the deserted holes of the woodpeckers.
In such places it also builds its nests. It has been known to excavate
a hole for itself even in hard sound wood. Its nest is simply a rude
lining of the selected cavity, composed of various soft and warm materials.
In this are deposited from six to eight eggs. But a single brood is raised in
a season. The young birds, as soon as they are fledged, hunt in company
with their parents, and remain associated with them until the following
<!--129.png--><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span>
spring. The eggs of this bird have a length of .75 of an inch and a breadth
of .56. They are of a rounded oval in shape, and are thickly sprinkled
with fine rust-colored dots, intermingled with a few larger markings of lilac,
on a white ground.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Valley of Rio Grande, south, into Mexico. San Antonio. Texas. Vera Cruz,
<span class="sc">Sclater</span>.</p>

<p>This species is not rare in Texas, where it has been noticed as far east as
San Antonio.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> So far as known, the Black-crested Titmouse is restricted in its
distribution to the valley of the Rio Grande, including portions of Mexico
and Western Texas. It was first met with in the latter State by John W.
Audubon, and described by Mr. Cassin in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia
Academy.</p>

<p>In its general appearance and in all its habits it is mentioned as having
so close a resemblance to the common Tufted Titmouse as to be hardly distinguishable
from that bird. Dr. Woodhouse met with this species near San
Antonio, Texas, in March, 1851. While his party was encamped on the Rio
Salado he observed these birds busily engaged in capturing insects among
the trees on the banks of the stream. Like all the members of this family,
it was incessantly in motion and very noisy. Later in the season, on the
8th of May, the same party, when encamped on the Quihi, again found this
species very abundant among the oaks. The young males, then fully grown,
closely resembled the adult females, both wanting the black crest that distinguishes
the mature male. He afterward noticed this species occurring at
intervals along his route as far as the head waters of the Rio San Francisco
in New Mexico. He observed it almost exclusively among the trees that
bordered streams of water. The females and the young males invariably had
crests of the same cinereous color as their general plumage, but in the latter
slightly tinged with brown. They occurred in small parties, were very lively
and sociable in their habits, and in their general appearance and even in
their notes so very closely resembled the Eastern species as, at a short distance,
to be hardly distinguishable from it.</p>

<p><!--130.png--><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span>
Dr. Heermann, in his report on the birds of Lieutenant Parke’s survey,
mentions having first observed this species near Fort Clarke, in Texas, where
it was very abundant. He describes it as sprightly and active in its movements,
searching with great assiduity for insects in the crevices of the bark
and among the branches of trees. While thus engaged it keeps up a chattering
note, varied with an occasional low and plaintive whistle. Its habits
appeared to him to resemble most those of the common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parus atricapillus</i>.
Dr. Heermann states that it builds its nest in the hollow of trees, and that
it lays from twelve to sixteen eggs. He does not, however, say that he
ever met with its eggs, nor does he give any description of them. The nest,
he states, is composed of fine dry grasses, feathers, wool, mosses, etc.</p>

<p>General Couch’s description of this species and its habits is very similar.
He observed it in the province of New Leon, in Mexico, where he found it
very abundant along the San Juan into the Sierra Madre. He describes it
as a very lively bird, with a very perfect whistle of a single note.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry A. Dresser sought very diligently for its nest and eggs near
San Antonio and Houston, in Texas, where he found the bird very common,
and where he was sure many pairs remained to breed, but its nest was very
hard to find, and the birds very wary. He succeeded in finding one nest,
in a hollow tree, near the head springs of the San Antonio River, but it
contained young. The nest he does not describe, nor does he mention the
number of young it contained.</p>

<span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Gray Titmouse belongs essentially to the Pacific coast,
coming eastward only as far as the banks of the Rio Grande in Texas. It
was first discovered and described by Dr. Gambel, in his Birds of California.
It has since been met with not only throughout California, but also in all
the southern portions of the Rocky Mountains, in New Mexico, and from
Mimbres to the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse met with this species in the San Francisco Mountains,
near the Little Colorado River, New Mexico. He found it very abundant,
feeding among the tall pines in company with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitta pygmæa</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. aculeata</i>,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parus montanus</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Gambel first noticed this species near Monterey on the 20th of November.
It was flitting actively about among the evergreen oaks of that
vicinity in company with large flocks of several kindred species. They
were all in restless activity, searching every branch for insects. As well
as he could distinguish its notes among those of the busy throng in the
midst of which he observed it, they appeared to resemble very closely those
of the common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. atricapillus</i>. Upon his following it up, it would utter a
loud scolding outcry, erect its high and pointed crest, and appear as angry
as possible at the intrusion. He found it very common, frequenting tall
bushes in small flocks, searching branches of low trees, uttering weak and
slender cries, resembling the syllables <i class="birdcall">tsēē dāy-dāy</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann found it one of the most common of the birds of California,
where it is resident throughout the year. He describes their notes as
possessing an almost endless variety, so much so that he was repeatedly
prompted to follow it as a new species. He met with a nest of this bird in
a deserted woodpecker’s hole, which contained young.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper has met with this species in February near San Diego, but
not on the Colorado. They seem to prefer the evergreen-oak groves toward
the middle of the State, but are not found in the higher Sierra Nevada.
They are residents throughout the year in the evergreen oaks near San
Francisco. He adds that they are seen in small parties, scattered about
the trees, and calling to each other with a variety of sweet and loud notes,
some of which are said to equal those of our best singers. It also has
certain powers of imitation like the Eastern crested species and the same
cry of <i class="birdcall">pēto-pēto</i>.</p>

<p>It feeds on acorns as well as insects, and often goes to the ground in search
of them. It cracks the acorns with its bill, and hammers at bark and decayed
wood with the industry of a woodpecker.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway met with this species among the pines of the eastern slope
of the Sierra Nevada, but nowhere in abundance. Among the cedars it was
almost the only bird seen. He describes its manners as greatly resembling
those of the other species. Its notes, though differing from those of the
Eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. bicolor</i>, being weaker and less distinct, retain its vehement and
characteristic manner of utterance.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Wollweber’s Titmouse, so far as its distribution is known, is
a bird of Western Texas, the high table-lands of Mexico, and of the whole
of New Mexico. It was described by Bonaparte and by Cassin nearly simultaneously,
in 1850. It bears a very close resemblance to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lophophanes
cristatus</i> of Europe.</p>

<p>Although comparatively nothing is known in reference to the specific habits
of this species, they may be very readily inferred from those of the other
members of this genus, whose characteristics are all so well marked and so
uniform. Dr. Kennerly is the only one of our naturalists who has mentioned
meeting the species in its living form. In his Report upon the Birds
of Lieutenant Whipple’s Survey he states that he found it in the thick bushes
along the Pueblo Creek. Wherever noticed it was constantly in motion,
hopping from twig to twig in search of its food. He also found it among
the pines of the Aztec Mountains. No mention is made of its nest or eggs,
and its nidification remains to be ascertained.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Mountain Chickadee was first met with by Dr. Gambel in
journeying westward from Santa Fé, in New Mexico, and from thence was
found in all the ranges of the Rocky
Mountains nearly to California. Its
notes and habits are said to closely
resemble those of the common Chickadee,
but weaker and more varied. It
keeps more in low bushes, where it
moves from branch to branch with
untiring activity, searching each minutely
for small insects. It also frequently
descends to the ground to
pick up small seeds. While thus occupied
it will occasionally stop, look
round, and, uttering a slender <i class="birdcall">te-de-de</i>, and then its usual note, <i class="birdcall">to-de-de-dait</i>,
will fly to another bush.</p>

<p>On the Rio Colorado they kept chiefly among the cotton-wood trees that
grew along its banks, and its familiar notes were almost the only sounds
heard. They were observed in large and busy flocks along the smaller
streams in company with the Least Tit and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Reguli</i>. Dr. Gambel did
not find them, however, so abundant on the California sides of the ridge,
where other species took their place.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann found this Titmouse abundant among the mountains surrounding
<!--135.png--><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</span>
the Volcano in the southern mines, and subsequently met with
them on the summit of the Tejon Pass. He thinks their notes and habits
very similar to those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i>. Dr. Suckley obtained a single
specimen at Fort Dalles, but regarded it as extremely rare in that locality.
Dr. Woodhouse found it quite abundant
in the San Francisco Mountains of New
Mexico, where it was feeding among the
tall pines in company with kindred
species.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found this species in
great abundance among the pines on
the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada
Mountains, as well as in all the extensive
cedar-groves on the mountains to
the eastward. Around Carson City this
species was found throughout the winter.
In its manners and notes, particularly the latter, it was hardly distinguishable
from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. carolinensis</i>. The notes are described as louder and more
distinct, though their calls in spring are rather less clearly articulated.</p>

<p>The entire crown, from the bill to the upper part of the back, coming

at the lower mandible and occupies the entire under surface of the head and
throat, but not extending as far back within a quarter of an inch as that on
the upper part of the neck. The space between these two patches, on the
sides of the head and neck, is white, this color extending along the black of
the back of the neck as far as its truncated extremity, but not bordering it
behind. The middle of the breast and belly, as far as the vent, is dull
white, that immediately behind the black of the throat a little clearer. The
sides of the breast and body under the wings, with the under tail-coverts,
are pale, dull brownish-white. The back, rump, and upper tail-coverts are
of a dirty bluish-ash, washed with yellowish-brown, especially on the rump.
The wings are brown; the outer edges of the third to the seventh primaries
narrowly edged with whitish; the innermost secondaries more broadly and
conspicuously edged with the same; larger coverts edged with dirty whitish.
Outer webs of tail-feathers edged with white, purest and occupying half the
web in the external one, narrowing and less clear to the central feathers, the
basal portions, especially, assuming more the color of the back.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Chickadee or Black-capped Titmouse is so well
known throughout the greater portion of the United States as to be generally
accepted, by common consent, as the typical representative of its
numerous family. Until recently it has been supposed to be universally
distributed over the continent, and while this is now questioned, it is not
quite clear where its limits occur. In Eastern Maine the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parus hudsonicus</i>
and this species meet. In the District of Columbia it crosses the northern
limits of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. carolinensis</i>, and in the northern Mississippi Valley it mingles
with the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">septentrionalis</i>. It remains to be ascertained how far the
species exceeds these bounds.</p>

<p>A few individuals of this species were observed by Mr. Dall, December
12, at Nulato, where, however, it was not common. They were also obtained
by Bischoff at Sitka and Kodiak.</p>

<p>As in very many essential respects the whole family of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paridæ</i> are alike
in their characteristics of habits, their manner of collecting food, their restless,
uneasy movements, the similarity of their cries, their residence in hollow
trees or branches, and their nesting in similar places, with the exception
only of a few species that construct their own pouch-like nests, we have
taken the best known as the common point of comparison. Except in the
variations in plumage, the points of difference are never great or very
noticeable.</p>

<p>In New England the Black-Cap is one of our most common and familiar
birds. In the vicinity of Calais, Mr. Boardman speaks of it as resident and
abundant. The writer did not meet with it in Nova Scotia, nor even in the
islands of the Bay of Fundy, where the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hudsonicus</i> is a common bird.</p>

<p>It is a resident species, nesting early in May, and having full-fledged nestlings
early in June. While it seems to prefer the edges of woods as best
affording the means of food and shelter, it by no means confines itself to
<!--139.png--><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 98]</span>
these localities, not only appearing familiarly around the dwellings in the
winter season, but also occasionally breeding in open and exposed places.
A hollow post of a fence in the midst of open cultivated fields, a decayed
stump near the side of a public highway, a hollow log in a frequented farmyard,
and even the side of an inhabited dwelling, are localities these birds
have been known to select in which to rear their young. In the winter
they not unfrequently extend their visits, in search of food, into the very
heart of large and crowded cities, where they seem as much at home and as
free from alarm as in the seclusion of the forest, searching every crack where
insect larvæ or eggs can be hid. On one occasion a pair had built its nest
over a covered well which connects with the dwelling by a side door, through
which water was drawn at all hours of the day by means of buckets and a
rope, the wheel for which was in close proximity to their nest. They manifested,
however, no uneasiness, and even after the young were ready to fly,
the whole family would return to the place for shelter at night and during
inclement weather.</p>

<p>Their courage and devotion to their young is a remarkable trait with the
whole race, and with none more than with the present species. On one
occasion a Black-Cap was seen to fly into a rotten stump near the roadside
in Brookline. The stump was so much decayed that its top was readily
broken off and the nest exposed. The mother refused to leave until forcibly
taken off by the hand, and twice returned to the nest when thus removed,
and it was only by holding her in the hand that an opportunity was given
to ascertain there were seven young birds in her nest. She made no complaints,
uttered no outcries, but resolutely and devotedly thrust herself between
her nestlings and the seeming danger. When released she immediately
flew back to them, covered them under her sheltering wings, and looked
up in the face of her tormentors with a quiet and resolute courage that could
not be surpassed.</p>

<p>The nest of the Chickadee is usually a warm and soft felted mass of the
hair and fur of the smaller quadrupeds, downy feathers, fine dry grasses and
mosses, lining the cavity in which it is placed and contracting it into a deep
and purse-like opening if the cavity be larger than is necessary. Usually the
site selected is already in existence, and only enlarged or altered to suit the
wishes of the pair. But not unfrequently, at some pains, they will excavate
an opening for themselves, not only in decaying wood, but even into
limbs or trunks that are entirely sound.</p>

<p>These birds in winter collect around the camps of the log-cutters, become
very tame, and seek on all occasions to share with their occupants their food,
often soliciting their portion with plaintive tones. Though nearly omnivorous
in the matter of food, they prefer insects to everything else, and
the amount of good conferred by them on the farmers and the owners of
woodlands in the destruction of insects in all their forms&mdash;egg, caterpillar,
larva, or imago&mdash;must be very great. No chrysalis is too large to resist
<!--140.png--><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span>
their penetrating bill, and no eggs so well hidden that they cannot find them
out. I have known one to attack and fly off with the chrysalis of a “Woolly-bear”
or salt-marsh caterpillar (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leucarctia acræa</i>). When thus foraging for
their food they seem totally unconscious of the near presence of man, and
unmindful of what is passing around them, so intent are they upon the
object of their pursuit.</p>

<p>The notes of the Chickadee exhibit a great variety of sounds and combinations.
As they roam through the country in small flocks in quest of food,
their refrain is a continued and lively succession of varying notes sounding
like a quaint chant. When annoyed by any intrusion, their cry is louder
and harsher. They are rarely thus disturbed by the presence of man, and
even when their nest is approached by him they present only a passive and
silent resistance. Not so when a cat or a squirrel is observed in unwelcome
vicinity. These are pursued with great and noisy pertinacity and hoarse
cries of <i class="birdcall">dāy, dāy, dāy</i>, in which they are often joined by others of the same
species.</p>

<p>So far as we have observed them, they are apparently affectionate, gentle,
and loving to each other. We utterly discredit the accusation that they
will treacherously beat out the brains of feeble birds of their own race. It
is unsupported by testimony, and in the instance cited by Wilson he gives
no evidence that this injury may not have been done by some other species,
and not by one of its own kindred.</p>

<p>Their nest is usually near the ground, and the number of eggs rarely
if ever exceeds eight. They are said to have two broods in the season,
but this statement seems to be contradicted by their continued presence
after June in small flocks, evidently the parents and their first and only
brood, who apparently remain together nine or ten months.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species vary somewhat in regard to the distribution and
number of the reddish-brown markings with which their white ground is
more or less sprinkled. In some they are chiefly gathered in a ring about
the larger end; in others they are distributed over the entire egg. Their
eggs are smaller and a little less spherical in shape than those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">septentrionalis</i>,
averaging .58 by .47 of an inch.</p>

and secondaries broadly edged with white, involving nearly the whole outer web of outer
tail-feather. Tail much graduated; the outer feather about .50 of an inch shorter than
the middle. Second quill about as long as the secondaries.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Region of Missouri River to Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>This race is very similar to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. atricapillus</i>, but differs from it
somewhat as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i> does from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carolinensis</i>. Its size is much greater;
the tail proportionally longer, and much more graduated; the white of
wing and tail purer and more extended. The bill appears to be stouter
and more conical. The back has, perhaps, a little more yellowish. The
spurious or first primary is larger.</p>

<p>It will be a difficult matter to retain this as a species distinct from
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i>, in view of the insensible gradation from one form to the other;
and it may be looked upon, with scarcely a doubt, as simply a long-tailed
Western variety of the common species. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. occidentalis</i>, and, probably, even
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. carolinensis</i>, may even fall under the same category, their peculiarities
of color and size being precisely such as would <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> be expected from
their geographical distribution.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Long-tailed Titmouse appears to have an extended distribution
between the Mississippi Valley and the Rocky Mountains, from Texas
into the British Possessions, specimens having been received from Fort
Simpson and Lake Winnipeg. Among the notes of the late Robert Kennicott
is one dated Lake Winnipeg, June 6, mentioning the dissection of a
female of this species found to contain a full-sized egg. A memorandum
made by Mr. Ross, dated at Fort William, May 15, speaks of this bird
as abundant at Fort Simpson, from August until November, the last having
been seen November 10. One was shot, June 2, on Winnipeg River, “a
female, who was about to lay her egg.”</p>

<p>In regard to its distinct individual history but little is as yet known. It
was discovered and first described by the late Edward Harris, of New Jersey,
who accompanied Mr. Audubon in his expedition to the upper branches of
the Missouri River, and who obtained this bird on the Yellowstone, about
thirty miles above its junction with the Missouri, on the 26th of July. He
describes its notes as similar to those of the common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i>, but less
harsh and querulous, and more liquid in their utterance. Subsequently
specimens were obtained by Mr. Kern, artist to the exploring expedition
under Fremont in 1846.</p>

<p>It is the largest species of this genus in America. In its breeding-habits
it is not different from the Eastern representatives. Mr. B. F. Goss found
this species breeding abundantly at Neosho Falls, in Kansas. They nest in
decayed stumps, hollow trees, branches, logs, etc., after the manner of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i>. The excavation is usually ten or twelve inches, and even
more, in depth. The nest is warmly made of a loose soft felt composed of
the fur and fine hair of small quadrupeds, feathers, and the finer mosses.</p>

<p><!--142.png--><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span>
The eggs, usually five, occasionally eight, in number, are of a rounded
oval shape, measuring .60 by .50 of an inch. They have a pure dull-white
ground, and the entire egg is very uniformly and pretty thickly covered
with fine markings and small blotches of red and reddish-brown intermingled
with a few dots of purplish.</p>

than the middle. Above dark brownish-ash; head and neck above and below black, separated
on the sides by white; beneath light, dirty, rusty yellowish-brown, scarcely whiter
along the middle of body. Tail and wings not quite so much edged with whitish as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Northwest coast region of the United States.</p>

<p>This race is of the same size as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. atricapillus</i>, and resembles it in its
markings; the ashy of the back is, however, washed with a darker shade
of yellowish-brown. The brown of the under parts is so much darker as to
cause the predominant color there to be a pale yellowish-brown, instead
of brownish-white. The fourth quill is longest; the fifth and sixth a little
shorter than the third; the second is about as long as the secondaries. The
tail is rounded, rather more so than in most <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i>, the difference in the
lengths of the feathers amounting to about .25 of an inch. The amount
of light margining to the quills and tail-feathers is much as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i>,
but rather less, perhaps, on the tail.</p>

<p>This seems to be the Pacific coast representative of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. atricapillus</i>,
as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">septentrionalis</i> belongs to the middle region, corresponding in its differences
with other Western representatives of Eastern species.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Dr. Cooper, in his Birds of Washington Territory, says of
this variety: “The common Black-capped Chickadee, so abundant in the
Eastern States, is, in Washington Territory, represented by the Western
Titmouse, frequenting the low thickets and trees, where it is always busily
employed seeking food.” He observed its nest near Puget Sound, burrowed
in soft rotten wood. Dr. Suckley found it quite abundant in the valley of
the Willamette, and also at Fort Vancouver during winter. In habits it
closely resembles the Black-Cap of the Eastern States.</p>

<p>It is chiefly found in Oregon and Washington Territory, visiting the
northern part of California in winter, when it is also abundant near the
Columbia River. At this season it is generally found among the deciduous
trees along streams and oak groves, seeking its food among the branches.
It feeds on seeds and insects, and is very fond of fresh meat, fat, and crumbs
<!--143.png--><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span>
of bread. They migrate but little, remaining at the Columbia River even
when the ground is covered with snow. The eggs are as yet unknown, but
without doubt they closely resemble those of the Eastern species.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
South Atlantic and gulf region of United States, north to Washington, D. C.,
Texas and the Mississippi Valley; north to Central Illinois; the only species in the
southern portion of the latter State.</p>

<p>This species is, in general, rather smaller than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. atricapillus</i>, although
the tail and wing appear to be of much the same size. The body and feet
are, however, smaller, and the extent of wing is three quarters of an inch
less. The bill is apparently shorter and stouter.</p>

<p>The primaries are proportionally and absolutely considerably longer than
the secondaries in the present species, the difference being .55 of an inch,
instead of .45. The tail is rather more rounded, the feathers narrower.</p>

<p>The tail is considerably shorter than the wing, instead of longer; the
black of the throat extends much farther back, is more dense and more
sharply defined behind, than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i>. Taking into view these differences,
and others of color, we feel justified in retaining this as a species
distinct from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i>, and, in fact, having <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">meridionalis</i> as its nearest
relative (see Synoptical Table). Both this species and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i> are found
together in the Middle States, each preserving its characteristics.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> South of the once famous line of Mason and Dixon this smaller
counterpart of the Chickadee seems to entirely replace it, although in New
Jersey and Pennsylvania, and occasionally even as far to the north as New
York City, the two occur together. Its range is presumed to be all the
States south of the Potomac and the Ohio, as far to the west as the Rio
Grande. It was probably this species, and not the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i>, which was
met with by Dr. Woodhouse in the Indian Territory. Without much doubt
it breeds in all the States south of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In Southern Illinois, as far north in the Wabash Valley as the mouth of
White River, this is the only species, unless the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. atricapillus</i> occasionally
occurs in winter. Specimens from this region are undistinguishable from
those taken in Georgia and the extreme Southern States, and do not present
the peculiar features of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. atricapillus</i>. It is a very abundant species,
<!--144.png--><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span>
and resident, being in winter one of the most common, as well as one of
the most familiar birds, inhabiting <em>all</em> localities, giving preference neither
to swampy woods nor to door-yards, for it is as often seen in one place as
another. It is never gregarious, though many may often be seen or heard at
the same moment. It begins incubation early in April, generally selecting
the wild plum and red-bud trees in the woods. This species very often
constructs its own nesting-places, and the soft wood of these trees is very
easily excavated. The excavation is generally made in a horizontal dead
limb, with the opening on the under side; this is neat and regular, and as
elaborate as those of any of the woodpeckers. Sometimes, however, a
natural cavity is selected, frequently in a prostrate stump or “snag.” The
nest is almost always a very elaborate structure, being a strong compact cup
or bed of “felt,” whose main material is rabbit-fur and cow-hair.</p>

<p>In its habits it seems to resemble more closely the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. palustris</i> of Europe
than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i>, being generally found only in the immediate vicinity
of ponds and deep, marshy, moist woods. It is also rarely found other
than singly or in pairs, the parent birds, unlike most of this family, separating
from their young soon after the latter are able to provide for themselves.
It rarely or never moves in flocks.</p>

<p>Their notes are said to be less sonorous and less frequent than those of our
Black-capped Titmouse. In the winter a portion retire from the coast in
South Carolina into the interior of the State and into Florida, where Mr.
Audubon found them, in the winter of 1831 and 1832, much more abundant
than he had ever seen them elsewhere. He found them breeding as
early as February, occasionally in the nests deserted by the Brown-headed
Nuthatch. A nest obtained by Dr. Bachman from a hollow stump, about
four feet from the ground, was in form cup-shaped, measuring two inches
internally in diameter at the mouth, and three externally, with a depth
of two inches. It was constructed of cotton, fine wool, a few fibres of
plants, and so elaborately felted together as to be of uniform thickness
throughout.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon was in error in regard to the eggs, which he describes as
pure white. Their ground-color is of pure crystalline whiteness, but they
are freely and boldly marked all over with deep reddish-brown and red spots.
These, so far as we have compared the eggs, are larger, more numerous, and
more deeply marked than are any eggs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i> we have ever met
with.</p>

<p>According to the observations of the late Dr. Alexander Gerhardt of
Whitfield County, Georgia, these birds usually breed in holes that have
been previously dug out by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus pubescens</i>, or in decaying stumps not
more than five or six feet from the ground. He never met with its nest in
living trees. The eggs are from five to seven in number, and are usually
deposited in Georgia from the 10th to the last of April.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are slightly larger than those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i>,
<!--145.png--><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 104]</span>
and the reddish-brown blotches with which they are profusely covered are
much more distinctly marked. They are of a spheroidal oval in shape,
have a pure white ground, very uniformly and generally sprinkled with
blotches of a reddish-brown. They measure .60 by .50 of an inch.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Chestnut-backed Titmouse was first obtained by Townsend
on the banks of the Columbia River, and described in the Journal of the
Philadelphia Academy. It is a resident, throughout the year, of the forests
of the Columbia, and is found throughout California. Like all of this
familiar family, they may be seen in small flocks, of all ages, in the autumn
and winter, moving briskly about, uttering a number of feeble querulous notes,
after the manner of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i>, but never joining in anything like the
quaint and jingling song of that bird. They occasionally have a confused
warbling chatter. These busy little groups may be often seen in company
with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parus occidentalis</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Regulus satrapa</i>, moving through the
bushes and thickets, carefully collecting insects, their larvæ and eggs, for a
few moments, and then flying off for some other place. They are supposed
to rear their young in the midst of the densest forests.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall states that when the gun thins their ranks the survivors display
surprising courage and solicitude, following their destroyer with wailing
cries, entreating for their companions.</p>

<p>Dr. Gambel found the young of this species in great abundance around
Monterey in the fall and winter months. Dr. Heermann saw them in June,
1852, feeding their young in the vicinity of San Francisco, where, however,
they are rare.</p>

<p>In Washington Territory, Dr. Cooper found this the most abundant species.
It preferred the dense evergreens, where large parties could be found at all
seasons busily seeking food among the leaves and branches, ascending even
to the highest tops. They were usually in company with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Reguli</i> and
the other Titmice. Mr. Bischoff found them abundant at Sitka.</p>

<p><!--146.png--><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span>
They nest, like all the others of this genus, in holes in soft decayed trunks
and large limbs of trees a few feet from the ground. Their eggs are not as
yet known.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parus sibiricus</i> of Europe is very similar in coloration and characters

being confined to the region below or near the eye. The smoky-gray of the

brighter rufescent-gray of the back, and is separated from it by an obscure,

in the northern parts of New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire. In the
heavily wooded mountain-valley of Errol, in the latter State, Mr. Maynard
met with this bird in the latter part of October, in company with the
common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i>. In the same month he also obtained two birds in
Albany, in the northwestern corner of Maine. A single specimen was
taken at Concord, Massachusetts, October 29, by Mr. William Brewster.</p>

<p>Near Calais it is resident, but not common. It is more abundant in the
islands of the Bay of Fundy, where it takes the place, almost exclusively,
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atricapillus</i>. The writer first met with these lively little wood-sprites
<!--147.png--><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span>
in 1850, in the thick swampy woods which cover one of the small islands
near Grand Menan. Their general appearance as they flitted through the
woods, or rustled restlessly among the tangled débris of decaying trees and
underbrush with which the forest was choked, was not unlike that of our
common Black-Cap. Yet there was an indescribable something both in their
cries and in their manners that at once suggested a difference of species. To
my ear their cries were sharper, clearer, and a trifle harsher. There was
none of that resonant jingle so full of charm in the Chickadee. Their notes,
too, were more articulate, more like distinct words, and were brought out at
certain times with an emphasis the effect of which was very striking.
Beginning with <i class="birdcall">tschā-dēē</i>, the <i class="birdcall">dēē-dēē-dēē</i> was reiterated with an almost
incessant volubility.</p>

<p>It seemed to be a more retiring bird, never frequenting the houses, but
keeping closely to thick and retired woods. Yet it is not a timid species, but
seemed entirely unmindful of our presence, or, when mindful of it, to resent
it as an impropriety, rather than to fear it as a danger. They apparently had
nests or young at the time of my visit, though I could not detect their locality.
One pair became at last so annoyed at my prolonged presence as to
manifest their uneasiness by keeping within a few feet of my head, following
me wherever I went, and without ceasing from their close surveillance
until I finally left their grove and emerged into the open country. All the
time they brought out the cry of <i class="birdcall">dēē-dēē</i> with a clear, ringing emphasis that
was almost startling.</p>

<p>A few days later, being at Halifax, Mr. Andrew Downes, the naturalist,
took me to the nest of these birds in a small grove in the vicinity of that
city. The nest was in a small beech-tree, and had been cut through the living
wood. The excavation, which was not more than two feet from the
ground, was about ten inches in depth, was in a horizontal position only
about two inches, where it turned abruptly downward, and from a width of
an inch and a half assumed a width of three, and a depth of seven or eight
inches. This was warmly lined with feathers and soft fur. The nest contained
young birds. These particulars we only ascertained when we had
laid bare the excavation by a sharp hatchet. Though disappointed in our
search for eggs, yet we witnessed a very touching manifestation of devotion
on the part of the parents, and of neighborly solicitude in various other inmates
of the grove, which was at once most interesting and a scene long to
be remembered.</p>

<p>With all the self-sacrificing devotion of the Black-Cap, these birds displayed
a boldness and an aggressive intrepidity that at once commanded
our respect and admiration. I never witnessed anything quite equal to it.
They flew at our faces, assailed our arms as we wielded the invading hatchet,
and it was difficult not to do them even unintentional injury without abandoning
our purpose. Before we could examine the nest they had entered,
and had to be again and again removed. As soon as we were satisfied that
<!--148.png--><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span>
the nest of this heroic pair did not contain what we sought, we left them, and
turned to look with equal admiration upon the indignant assembly of feathered
remonstrants by which we were surrounded. The neighboring trees
swarmed with a variety of birds, several of which we had never before seen
in their summer homes. There were the Red-Poll Warbler, the Black and
Yellow Warbler, and many others, all earnestly and eloquently crying out
shame upon our proceedings.</p>

<p>Dr. Bryant, in his Notes on the Birds of Yarmouth, <abbr title="Nova Scotia">N. S.</abbr>, etc., mentions
finding quite a number of this species on Big Mud Island, near that place.
A pair of these birds with their young were seen by him near Yarmouth on
the <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> of July. Their habits seemed to him identical with those of the
Black-Cap. The young were fully grown and could fly with ease, yet their
parents were so solicitous about their safety that he could almost catch them
with his hand. Their notes appeared to him similar to those of our common
species, but sharper and more filing, and can be readily imitated by repeating,
with one’s front teeth shut together, the syllables <i class="bircall">tzēē-dēē-dēē-dēē</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon found a nest of this Titmouse in Labrador. It was built in a
decayed stump about three feet from the ground, was purse-shaped, eight
inches in depth, two in diameter, and its sides an inch thick. It was entirely
composed of the finest fur of various quadrupeds, chiefly of the northern
hare, and all so thickly and ingeniously matted throughout as to seem as if
felted by the hand of man. It was wider at the bottom than at the top.
The birds vehemently assailed the party.</p>

<p>Mr. Ross, in notes communicated to the late Mr. Kennicott, mentions that
specimens of this species were shot at Fort Simpson, October 13, in company
with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. septentrionalis</i>, and others were afterwards seen towards the
mountains. The notes he describes as harsher than those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">septentrionalis</i>.
The Smithsonian museum contains specimens from Fort Yukon and
Great Slave Lake, besides the localities already referred to. Mr. Dall found
it the commonest Titmouse at Nulato, abundant in the winter, but not present
in the spring.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species measure .56 by .47 of an inch, are of a rounded
oval shape, and with a white ground are somewhat sparingly marked with
a few reddish-brown spots. These are usually grouped in a ring around the
larger end.</p>

and there is no reliable evidence of
its crossing the United States boundary line, unless Mr. Ridgway is correct
in his assurance that he saw it in the East Humboldt Mountains of Nevada,
near Fort Ruby. It was first described from Guatemalan specimens. Mr.
O. Salvin (Ibis, 1866, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 190) states that on more than one occasion he
observed what he believed to be this species, in the pine-woods of the
mountains near Solola, and above the lake of Atitlan.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This interesting little species was first added to our fauna by the
indefatigable Mr. Townsend in 1837. It
is abundant throughout the Pacific coast
from Fort Steilacoom to Fort Tejon. Dr.
Gambel found it exceedingly abundant
both in the Rocky Mountains and throughout
California. During the winter the
otherwise cheerless woods were alive with
the busy and noisy troops of these restless
and industrious birds, gleaning their scanty
fare in company with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Reguli</i>, in every
possible position and manner, from bush and tree. He describes their anxious
solicitous search for food as quite curious. They kept up a continual
twittering, and so intent were they in their employment that they appeared
to lose sight of all danger, and it was by no means unusual to be so surrounded
by a flock as almost to render it possible to catch them in the hand.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found this species abundant in Washington Territory, but
never met with it north of the Columbia River. Dr. Suckley says it is quite
common at Fort Steilacoom. He could not, however, detect any difference
in its habits from those of other species of this family. He saw none in
Washington Territory during the winter, and presumes they all migrate to
the South, though the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rufescens</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">occidentalis</i> are found there throughout
the winter. Townsend, however, speaks of it as a constant resident
about the Columbia River, hopping around among the bushes, hanging from
the twigs in the manner of other Titmice, twittering all the while with a
rapid enunciation resembling the words <i class="birdcall">thshish tshist-tsee-twee</i>.</p>

<p><!--151.png--><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span>
Mr. Nuttall first observed their arrival on the banks of the Wahlamet River
about the middle of May. They were very industriously engaged in quest
of insects, and were by no means shy, but kept always in the low bushes in
the skirts of the woods. On one occasion the male bird was so solicitous in
regard to the safety of the nest as to attract him to the place where, suspended
from a low bush, about four feet from the ground, hung their curious
home. It was formed like a long purse, with a round hole for entrance near
the top, and made of moss, down, lint of plants, and lined with feathers.
The eggs were six in number, pure white, and already far gone toward hatching.
In the following June, in a dark wood near Fort Vancouver, he saw
a flock of about twelve, which, by imitating their chirping, he was able to
call around him, and which kept up an incessant and querulous chirping.</p>

<p>A nest of this bird presented by Mr. Nuttall to Audubon was cylindrical in
form, nine inches in length and three and a half in diameter. It was suspended
from the fork of a small twig, and was composed externally of hypnum,
lichens, and fibrous roots so interwoven as to present a smooth surface, with
a few stems of grasses and feathers intermingled. The aperture was at the
top, and did not exceed seven eighths of an inch in diameter. The diameter
of the internal passage for two thirds of its length was two inches. This
was lined with the cottony down of willows and a vast quantity of soft
feathers. The eggs were nine in number, pure white, .56 of an inch by .44
in their measurement.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found them throughout the year near San Francisco. He
found one of their nests at San Diego as early as the first of March. The
nest is so large, compared with the size of the birds, as to suggest the idea
that the flock unite to build it. He gives the measurements as eight inches
in length and three in diameter, outside; the cavity five inches long, one
and a half in diameter. It was cylindrical, and suspended by one end from
a low branch.</p>

<p>When one of these birds is killed, Dr. Cooper says that the others come
round it with great show of anxiety, and call plaintively until they find it
will not follow them, becoming so fearless as almost to allow of their being
taken by the hand.</p>

<span class="sc">Hab.</span> Southern Rocky Mountain region of United States, from mountains of West
Arizona to Green River, Wyoming; west to Carson City, Nevada (<span class="sc">Ridgway</span>).</p>

<p>This variety is very similar to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Psaltriparus minimus</i> of the west coast,
which it represents in the Rocky Mountain region. It is, however, appreciably
larger, the wings and tail proportionally longer. The top of the head is
plumbeous, uniform with the back, instead of smoky-brown. The back is a
paler ash, the under parts darker.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Of the history of this variety but little is known. It is found in
the southern portion of the Rocky Mountain regions, within the United
States, in Arizona and New Mexico. The extent of its area of distribution
remains to be ascertained. Dr. Kennerly met with it on Little Colorado
River, where he observed it among the scattered bushes along the banks of
the river, occurring in large flocks. These passed rapidly from place to place,
uttering their short, quick notes. He afterward met with them along the
head waters of Bill Williams Fork, inhabiting the tops of the cotton-wood
trees. When attracted to them by their notes, they could only be seen after
a very careful search. He obtained no knowledge as to their mode of nesting,
and no information, so far as we are aware, has been obtained in regard
to their eggs. It may, however, be safely conjectured that they are white,
and hardly distinguishable from those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minimus</i>. Dr. Coues found
them common near Fort Whipple, Arizona.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway met with this bird in especial abundance among the cañons
of West Humboldt Mountains in September. He found it also in all suitable
places westward to the very base of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. It
was met with principally in the thick brushwood bordering the streams, in
ever-restless companies, continually twittering as they flew from bush to
bush, in single rows. Mr. Ridgway describes these birds as remarkably
active in their movements. If unmolested, they were exceedingly unsuspicious
and familiar. During November he found them inhabiting the
cedars, always associating in scattered flocks.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This new and interesting little species was first added to our
fauna by Mr. Lawrence in 1851, only a year
after its first description as a bird of Mexico.
Notwithstanding the abundance in which it
has been in certain localities, less has been
developed in regard to its habits and specific
characteristics than we seem to have had a
right to anticipate.</p>

<p>It was found in Western Texas, in Mexico,
in the lower valleys of New Mexico and
Arizona, and is very abundant at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Lucas. Of the eighteen species of birds found by Mr. John Xantus breeding
in the last-named locality, this one was regarded as the most abundant.
In a letter from that gentleman, written in August, 1859, he mentioned
that he had collected over one hundred eggs of this species, during that
season, in the immediate vicinity of Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann, in his report on the birds observed in Lieutenant Williamson’s
explorations, states that he first discovered this species in Southern
California, at the terminus of the Mohave
River. Owing to their extreme wildness,
he was not able to obtain any specimens.
In searching for their food, he states that
they often remained suspended with their
backs downward, after the manner of the
Titmice. He found their nests quite
abundant, though from the lateness of
the season few of the birds were remaining,
in the neighborhood of Fort
Yuma. Dr. Heermann describes their
nests as spherical, formed of twigs, and having the entrance on one side.
The interior was lined with down and feathers, and contained usually from
<!--154.png--><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span>
four to six eggs. These he describes as having, when fresh, a ground-color
of pale blue, dashed all over with small black spots.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly, in his Report on the Birds of the Mexican Boundary Survey,
states that he met with this species in the vicinity of the Rio Grande. They
were very wild, flew rapidly, and to quite a distance before they alighted.
They seemed to frequent the low mezquite-bushes on the hillsides.</p>

<p>Mr. Xantus found this species, when he first arrived at San Lucas, on the
4th of April, with young birds already fully fledged, although others were
still breeding and continued to breed until the middle of July. Two fifths
of all the eggs he collected that season, he writes, were of this species. This
may, however, have been in part owing to the conspicuous prominence of
their nests, as well as to their abundance. Xantus found the nest in various
positions. In one instance it was suspended from a leafless branch
not three feet from the ground, with its entrance nearly to the ground. In
another instance it was on an acacia twenty feet from the ground. For
the most part they are hung from low acacia-trees, on the extreme outer
branches. In all cases the entrance to the nest was from the lower end, or
towards the ground.</p>

<p>Dr. J. G. Cooper, in his History of the Birds of California, speaks of finding
a large number of this beautiful little bird during the whole winter frequenting
the thickets of algarobia and other shrubs, and with habits intermediate
between those of Titmice and Warblers, corresponding with their
intermediate form. Their song resembles that of the Chickadee, and they
also uttered a loud cry, as they sat on high twigs, with a triple lisping note
resembling <i class="birdcall">tzee-tee-tee</i>. Dr. Cooper found a pair building on the 10th of
March. They first formed a wall, nearly spherical in outline, of the thorny
twigs of the algarobia, in which tree the nest was usually built. They then
lined it with softer twigs, leaves, the down of plants, and feathers. They
covered the outside with thorns, until it became a mass as large as a man’s
head, or nine inches by five and a half on the outside. The cavity is four
and a half inches by two, with an opening on one side just large enough for
the bird to enter. On the 27th of March, Dr. Cooper found the first nest
containing eggs. These were in all instances four in number, pale blue,
with numerous small brown spots, chiefly near the larger end, though some
had very few spots and were paler. Their size he gives as .60 by .44 of an
inch. In one nest, which he closely observed, the eggs were hatched after
about ten days’ incubation, and in two weeks more the young were ready to
leave their nest.</p>

 <p class="center small"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitta aculeata.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common White-bellied Nuthatch has an extended distribution
throughout nearly the whole of Eastern North America, from the Atlantic
to the Rocky Mountains. West of the great central plains it is replaced
by the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aculeata</i>. It has not been
met with, so far as I am aware, farther
north than Nova Scotia. It is a resident
of Eastern Maine, and is quite
common in the southern and western
portions of the same State. In Massachusetts
it is rather common than abundant,
and more plentiful in the western
than in the eastern portions of that
State.</p>

<p>The habits of this and the other species
of Nuthatches partake somewhat of those
of the smaller Woodpeckers and of the
Titmice. Without the noisy and restless
activity of the latter, they seek their food
in a similar manner, and not unfrequently do so in their company, moving up
or down the trunks and over or under the branches of trees, searching every
crack and crevice of the bark for insects, larvæ, or eggs. Like the Woodpeckers,
they dig industriously into decayed branches for the hidden grub, and like
both Woodpeckers and Chickadees they industriously excavate for themselves
a place for their nests in the decayed trunks of forest trees. Their nest, however,
is usually at a greater elevation, often some twenty or thirty feet from
the ground. The European Nuthatch is said to plaster up the entrance
to its nest, to contract its opening and lessen the dangers of unfriendly
intrusion. This habit has never been observed in any of the American
species.</p>

<p>All our ornithological writers have noticed the assiduities of the male
bird to his sitting mate, and the attention with which he supplies her with
food. He keeps ever in the vicinity of the nest, calls her from time
to time to come to the mouth of the hole to take her food, or else to
receive his endearments and caresses, and at the approach of danger
fearlessly intervenes to warn her of it. When feeding together, the male
bird keeps up his peculiar nasal cry of <i class="birdcall">hŏnk-hŏnk</i>, repeating it from time
to time, as he moves around the trunk or over the branches.</p>

<p>Their favorite food is insects, in every condition. With this, when abundant,
they seem content, and rarely wander from their accustomed woods in
summer. In winter, when snow or ice covers the branches or closes against
them the trunks of trees, they seek the dwellings and out-houses for their
<!--159.png--><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 116]</span>
necessary food, and will even alight on the ground in quest of seeds. In
searching for food among the trees, they move as readily with their heads
downward as in any other position. Their motion is a uniform and steady
progression, somewhat in the manner of a mouse, but never, like the Woodpecker,
by occasional hops.</p>

<p>The European species collect and store away the fruit of the hazel and
other nut-bearing trees. Our bird has been supposed to do the same thing,
but this is by no means an indisputable fact.</p>

<p>In some parts of the country absurd prejudices prevail against these interesting
little birds. They are indiscriminately confounded with the smaller
Woodpeckers, called, with them, Sap-Suckers, and because in the spring and
fall they frequent old orchards are most unwisely, as well as unjustly, persecuted.
They are among the most active and serviceable of the fruit-grower’s
benefactors. His worst enemies are their favorite food. It is to be hoped
that soon a better-informed public opinion will prevail, cherishing and protecting,
rather than seeking to destroy, this useful, affectionate, and attractive
species.</p>

<p>Interesting accounts are given in English works of the confiding tameness
of the European species. When kindly treated, it will come regularly for
its food, approaching within a foot or two of the hand of its benefactor,
and catching with its bill the food thrown to it before it can reach the
ground.</p>

<p>The pair work together in constructing the perforation in which they make
their nest. When the excavation has been well begun, they relieve each
other at the task. The one not engaged in cutting attends upon its mate,
and carries out the chips as they are made. These nesting-places are often
quite deep, not unfrequently from fifteen to twenty inches. Audubon states
that they build no nest, but this does not correspond with my observations.
In all the instances that have come to my knowledge, warm and soft nests
were found, composed of down, fur, hair, or feathers loosely thrown together,
and, though not large in bulk, yet sufficient for a lining for the enlarged
cavity that completes their excavation. Soon after they are hatched, the
young climb to the opening of the nest to receive their food, and, before
they are ready to fly, venture out upon the trunk to try their legs and claws
before their wings are prepared for use, retiring at night to their nest. In
the Southern States they are said to have two broods in a season.</p>

<p>The eggs of this Nuthatch measure .80 by .62 of an inch. Their ground-color
is white, but when the egg is fresh it has a beautiful roseate tinge, and
generally receives an apparently reddish hue from the very general distribution
of the spots and blotches of rusty-brown and purplish with which the
eggs are so closely covered. These markings vary greatly in size, from fine
dots to well-marked blotches. Their color is usually a reddish-brown;
occasionally the markings are largely intermixed with purple.</p>

<p>The characters given above express the essential differences between this
and the Eastern race of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. carolinensis</i>. In the present form, the depth of the
bill opposite its base is .14, the width .17, and .80 or more in length
from the forehead; while these same measurements in <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carolinensis</i>
are .17, .22, and .70. The obsolete character of the black spots on the
secondaries is a persistent feature in the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aculeata</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This bird chiefly differs from its eastern congener in its more
slender bill. There appears to be no difference in regard to their habits, at
least none have been noticed, and it is probable there is none other than
trivial changes caused by its opportunities of procuring food, and the kinds
upon which it subsists. It is supposed to be distributed throughout Western
North America, from the British Possessions to Mexico, though Dr. Cooper
thinks that it is not a common bird south of San Francisco, and only to be
seen there in the colder months. It has been met with at San Diego in February.
He did not observe any in the Coast Mountains, near Santa Cruz,
but northward they are numerous in the summer, frequenting chiefly the
groves of the deciduous oaks, creeping constantly about their trunks and
branches in search of insects, which they also occasionally seek on the roofs
and walls of houses. Their habits are similar to those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. canadensis</i>, but
their movements are said to be slower, and their note is a single harsh call,
uttered occasionally, and responded to by their comrades. Dr. Cooper found
them quite common in Washington Territory and at Puget Sound. Dr.
Suckley also mentions their great abundance.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly met with this species a hundred miles west of Albuquerque,
New Mexico, and quite abundant among the pines of the Sierra Madre. He
speaks of its note as being peculiar.</p>

<p>Mr. J. K. Lord states that this species remained about Colville during the
winter, when the thermometer was 30<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> below zero. He also mentions that
he found them nesting, in June, in the branches of the tallest pine-trees, so
high up as to render the obtaining their eggs almost an impossibility.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found the Slender-billed Nuthatch abundant, throughout the
<!--161.png--><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span>
year, in the vicinity of Carson City, among the pines on the Sierra Nevada
Mountains. He noted its great similarity in manners to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carolinensis</i>; at
the same time the well-marked difference in the notes did not escape his
attention. These notes are much weaker, and are uttered in a finer tone, and
some of them are said to be entirely different.</p>

Whole United States and British Provinces. North to Lake Winnipeg.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Red-bellied Nuthatch, though nowhere a very
abundant species, is found throughout the whole of North America, from
Florida to high northern regions, and from ocean to ocean. The Smithsonian
Institution possesses specimens from Georgia, Selkirk Settlement, California,
and Washington Territory. Mr. Gambel found them quite common in the
mountains in the interior of California, in October, roving in company with
busy flocks of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parus montanus</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper met with them abundantly in Washington Territory, where
they preferred the oaks and other deciduous trees, and never frequented the
interior of the dense forest. He observed this bird and the Slender-billed
Nuthatch, along the 49th parallel, east of the Cascade Mountains, as late as
the middle of October. Dr. Suckley also met both birds west of the same
mountains.</p>

<p>This Nuthatch was observed by Mr. Ridgway among the aspen groves bordering
the streams that flow from the East Humboldt Mountains. In that
locality it was common through the month of September, though not abundant.
It was again seen in June among the pine-woods of the Wahsatch
Mountains, but it was not common.</p>

<p>While a few of these birds are resident of the Northern States, they are,
to a considerable extent, of migratory habits. Wilson observed them leaving
in large numbers for the Southern States in October, and returning again in
April. On the 20th of May, 1867, the writer observed a small flock in
Eastern Massachusetts, evidently just arrived from the South. They were
apparently fatigued and hungry, and paid no attention to the near presence
<!--162.png--><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span>
of workmen engaged in setting bean-poles. They visited and carefully
examined each pole, and bored holes into several in search of hidden larvæ,
often within a few feet of persons at work.</p>

<p>While on the Pacific coast they are said to prefer the forests of deciduous
trees, and to be rarely found in the dark evergreen forests, in the Eastern
States they seem to be particularly fond of the seeds of pine-trees, and in
the winter are seldom found in the woods of deciduous trees.</p>

<p>They feed in pairs and climb about in all directions, usually in company
with the white-breasted species, Chickadees, and the smaller Woodpeckers.
They are restless and rapid in their motions, and have a voice at least an
octave higher than any other of this family. The note is a monotone, and is
unmusical. Mr. Nuttall represents their cry as consisting of three syllables,
represented by <i class="birdcall">dāy-dāy-dāit</i>, and compares it to the sound of a child’s
trumpet.</p>

<p>Those wintering at the North occasionally visit farm-yards and orchards,
and examine the eaves of outbuildings for food.</p>

<p>Audubon found this species more plentiful in the woods of Maine and
Nova Scotia than anywhere else. He never met any south of Maryland,
saw none in Newfoundland, and only met with one in Labrador. At Eastport
he found a pair breeding as early as the 19th of April, before the
Bluebirds had made their appearance, and while ice was still remaining on
the northern exposures. An excavation had been made in a low dead stump,
less than four feet from the ground, both male and female birds working
by turns until they had reached the depth of fourteen inches. The eggs,
four in number, were of a white ground-color, tinged with a deep blush
when fresh, and sprinkled with reddish dots. They raise but a single brood
in a season.</p>

<p>C. S. Paine, of East Bethel, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, found a nest of this species about the
middle of May, in a small beech-tree, the excavation having been made at
the height of twelve feet from the ground. The hole was about as large as
that made by the Downy Woodpecker. When first noticed, the bird was
looking out of the hole. Having been started out, she flew to a limb close
by and watched the party some time. When she flew back, she buzzed
before the hole in the manner of a Humming-Bird, and then darted in.
While Mr. Paine was looking on, the male came several times to feed his
mate, who would meet him at the opening with a clamorous noise, to receive
his bounty. The nest contained five eggs.</p>

<p>In Western Massachusetts, Mr. Allen speaks of this species as chiefly a
winter resident, appearing the first week in October, and leaving the last
of April.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species measure .62 by .48 of an inch, and are of an
oblong-oval shape. Their ground-color is a clear crystal white, marked
principally about the larger end with a wreath of purple and roseate
markings.</p>

Above ashy-blue; head and upper part of neck greenish ashy-brown, its
lower border passing a little below the eye, where it is darker; nape with an obscure
whitish spot. Chin and throat whitish; rest of lower parts brownish-white; the sides
and behind like the back, but paler. Middle tail-feather like the back; its basal half with
a long white spot; its outer web edged with black at the base. Length about 4 inches;
wing, 2.40.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Western and Middle Provinces of United States; south to Xalapa.</p>

<p>This species is closely related to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitta pusilla</i> of the Southern States.
The brown of the head has, however, an olivaceous-green tinge not seen
in the other; the white spot on the nape less distinct. The middle tail-feather
has its basal half white and the outer web edged with black at the
base. This black edging is never seen in the other, and the white patch is
reduced to a faint trace, only visible in very highly plumaged specimens.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This diminutive species of Nuthatch is found throughout our
Pacific coast and on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains, from Washington
Territory to Southern California. It is also to be found in New
Mexico, and specimens have been procured from Mexico.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly found them quite abundant in the Sierra Madre and San
Francisco Mountains, even as high up as the snow-line, seeking their insect
food among the tops of the lofty pines. Dr. Newberry frequently met with
these Nuthatches in the most wooded places on his route, where water was
near and any considerable amount of animal life visible. He, however,
never met with them in the forests of yellow pines. Dr. Gambel mentions
their almost extraordinary abundance, in the winter months, in Upper California.
Around Monterey, at times, the trees appeared almost alive with
them, as they ran up and down and around the branches and trunks, uttering
their monotonous and querulous cries. Their note he describes as a
repeated whistling <i class="birdcall">wit-wit</i>. When one utters this cry, the rest join in.
They also have a whistling trill while they are busily searching the tree in
every part, and they never leave till they have pretty thoroughly searched
every crack.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper only met with this Nuthatch in the open pine-forests about
Fort Colville, near the 49th parallel. They were associated in small flocks
about the 20th of October, when there were heavy frosts at night. The
chirping noise they made resembled the cries of young chickens. Their
habits were very similar to those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Psaltriparus minimus</i>.</p>

<p><!--164.png--><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 121]</span>
Mr. J. K. Lord found this Nuthatch an abundant bird along the entire
length of the boundary line from the coast to the Rocky Mountains. It was
also common on Vancouver Island. They were seen in large flocks in company
with the Chickadees, except during the nesting-time, which is in June.
A few were winter residents at Colville, but the greater number left in
November. He describes it as a very active bird, always on the move.
After nesting they congregate in large flocks and move about from tree to
tree, twittering a low sweet note as if singing to themselves, now climbing
back downwards along the under sides of the topmost branches of tall pines,
searching into every crevice for insects, or, descending to the ground, clinging
to the slender flower-stalks for other insects. They nest in June, make
a hole in the dead branch of a pine, and deposit their eggs on the bare chips
of the wood. This account does not agree with the experience of California
ornithologists, who have found a loose nest within the excavation.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found this Nuthatch abundant among the pines of the Sierra
Nevada, in the vicinity of Carson City. They were found generally in pairs.
Its note is said to greatly resemble the vociferous peeping of some of the
small Sandpipers, being sharp, loud, and distinct, and vigorously and continuously
uttered, whether climbing or flying. He found it exceedingly hard to
discover this bird among the branches, or even when flying, owing to the
swiftness and irregularity of its flight. When the female of a pair had been
killed, the male bird was extremely loud in his lamentations. Diminutive
as this bird is, Mr. Ridgway states that it is also the noisiest of all the feathered
inhabitants of the pines, though it is less active in the pursuit of insects
than the larger species.</p>

<p>Nests of this bird obtained near Monterey appear to be as well made as
those of any of this genus, lining the cavity in which they are placed and
conforming to it in size and shape, the materials sufficiently interwoven to
permit removal and preservation, and warmly constructed of feathers, wool,
vegetable down, hair, and the silky efflorescence of seeds.</p>

<p>Their eggs, seven in number, resemble those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. canadensis</i>, but are
of smaller size and a little more pointed at one end. Their ground-color
is crystalline-white. This is covered more or less thickly with red spots, most
numerous at the larger end. Their measure varies from .65 by .50 to .60 by
.47 of an inch. The first eggs of this bird brought to the notice of naturalists
were procured at Fort Crook on the Upper Sacramento of California, and
not far from Mount Shasta, by Sergeant John Feilner, U. S. <abbr title="Army">A.</abbr>, forming part
of a very extensive collection of birds and eggs transmitted by him to the
Smithsonian Institution. Promoted to a lieutenancy for gallant conduct,
this gentleman finally attained the rank of captain of cavalry, and was killed
by the Sioux during an exploring expedition into Dacotah under General
Sully.

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Brown-headed Nuthatch has a much more restricted distribution
than the other members of this family in this country. The specimens
in the Smithsonian Museum are chiefly from Georgia. Wilson met
with it in Virginia, and states that it is found in the other Southern States.
I have received its eggs from Cheraw, <abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>, and from Florida.</p>

<p>Wilson’s description of its habits makes them almost identical with those
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitta canadensis</i>, while its notes are more shrill and chirping. Like that
bird, it is very fond of the seeds of the pines. Wherever found, it is a constant
resident, and does not migrate.</p>

<p>Audubon states that this bird never goes farther north than Maryland,
and that it is the most abundant in Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas.
In Louisiana it is rare, and it is not found in Kentucky. Its notes,
he states, are several octaves higher than those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carolinensis</i>, and
more shrill, and at least an octave and a half higher than those of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">canadensis</i>.</p>

<p>Although apparently preferring pines and pine barrens, it by no means
confines itself to them, but is not unfrequently seen on low trees and fences,
mounting, descending, and turning in every direction, and with so much quickness
of motion as to render it difficult to shoot it. It examines every hole
and every crevice in the bark of trees, as well as their leaves and twigs,
among which it finds abundance of food at all seasons. During the breeding-season
they go about in pairs and are very noisy. Their only note is a monotonous
cry, described as resembling <i class="birdcall">dĕnd, dĕnd</i>. Mr. Audubon further
states that when the first brood leaves the nest, the young birds keep together,
moving from tree to tree with all the activity of their parents, who
join them when the second brood is able to keep them company. In Florida
they pair in the beginning of February, having eggs as early as the middle
of that month. In South Carolina they breed one month later. Their nest
is usually excavated by the birds themselves in the dead portion of a low
stump or sapling, sometimes only a few feet from the ground, but not unfrequently
at the height of thirty or forty feet. Both birds are said to work in
<!--166.png--><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span>
concert with great earnestness for several days, until the hole, which is round,
and not larger at the entrance than the body of the bird, is dug ten or twelve
inches deep, widening at the bottom. The eggs, according to Mr. Audubon,
are laid on the bare wood. This, however, is probably not their constant
habit. The eggs, from four to six in number, and not much larger than those
of the Humming-Bird, have a white ground, thickly sprinkled with fine reddish-brown
dots. They are said to raise two, and even three, broods in a
season. According to the observations of the late Dr. Gerhardt of Northern
Georgia, the Brown-headed Nuthatch breeds in that part of the country about
the 19th of April.</p>

<p>The eggs of this Nuthatch are of a rounded oval shape, measuring .60 by
.50 of an inch. Their white ground-color is so completely overlaid by a profusion
of fine dottings of a dark purplish-brown as to be entirely concealed,
and the egg appears almost as if a uniform chocolate or brown color.</p>

<p>There is never any deviation from the generic <em>pattern</em> of coloration; but
the variation, <em>among individuals of each form</em>, in length of the bill and claws,
as well as the tail, is remarkable.</p>

Beneath almost silky-white; the under tail-coverts with a faint rusty tinge. A white

<p>Specimens from the far west are purer white beneath, much as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">costæ</i>,
but those from the northwest coast have the white tinged with light rusty.
Though purer white below, these specimens are much browner above than
Eastern ones,&mdash;sometimes more so than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">familiaris</i>, but then there is
the yellowish crissum never seen in this “species,” and the proportions are
quite different. Thus it will be seen the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. americana</i> may always be distinguished
<!--169.png--><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span>
from the other forms; when most resembling <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">costæ</i> in the grayish
tints of the upper plumage (as in Eastern examples), the lower parts are less
purely white, and the bill and claws smaller; when like it in the proportions
and pure white of the lower parts (as in Western specimens), the colors above
are altogether more brown. The yellowish crissum of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">americanus</i> will
also distinguish them. Though often resembling <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">familiaris</i> in the colors of
the upper parts, the latter may always be distinguished by its ashy lower
parts without yellowish crissum, the shorter tail, with its less acute feathers,
and stouter bill.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. mexicanus</i> is still more different in colors, for which see that variety.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Our common Creeper, so closely resembling the Creeper of Europe
as by many to be supposed identical with it, is distributed over the
whole of North America, from the Gulf of Mexico to high northern latitudes.
At different seasons it may be found in every one of the several States and
Territories, yet it is never very abundant. The Smithsonian possesses specimens
from various parts of the country, from Georgia to Fort Steilacoom on
the Pacific, but of these none appear to have been secured during the period
of reproduction. Dr. Heermann found them very common in the more
mountainous districts of California. Dr. Cooper found these birds abundant
in the forests of Washington Territory, but difficult to detect from the similarity
of their color to that of the bark over which they crept. They were
apparently constant residents in that Territory. Dr. Suckley, who obtained
several specimens of this species in the oak groves in the vicinity of Fort
Steilacoom, states that in their habits the Western birds resemble those of the
Atlantic States.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found this Creeper inhabiting both the pine forests of the
Sierra Nevada, where it was the more common, and also, in winter, among
the willows of the river valleys. He did not meet with it east of the Truckee
River, nor until he had reached the Wahsatch Mountains.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse found the Brown Creeper generally distributed throughout
the Indian Territory, Texas, New Mexico, and California, and adds that it
was especially abundant in the San Francisco Mountains of New Mexico.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper states that he has met with this form in the winter throughout
the higher mountains and among the Coast Range as far south as Santa
Cruz. He found them chiefly frequenting the coniferous trees, creeping up
and down their trunks and branches, searching for insects in their crevices,
and so nearly resembling the bark in their general color, that they can be
detected only with great difficulty, except when in motion.</p>

<p>He adds that their notes are shrill and wiry, and are often heard when the
bird is scarcely visible, without a careful search, their cry appearing to be
from a greater distance than the real performer. In March, Dr. Cooper heard
them giving out a faint but sharp-toned song, resembling that of a Wren.
If Dr. Cooper is correct in his account of the notes, they do not correspond
with those of our Eastern bird.</p>

<p><!--170.png--><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span>
Dr. Kennerly, in his Report on the birds observed by him near the 35th
parallel, states that he found our common Creeper very abundant among the
rough-barked cedars in the Aztec Mountains. It usually attracted notice,
and its place of retreat was discovered, by his hearing its quick and sharp
notes. A close and careful search generally enabled him to perceive it proceeding
leisurely upward and downward, in straight or spiral lines, toward
the top of the tree, dodging dexterously to the opposite side from the observer,
and only resuming its occupation when assured of solitude and safety.</p>

<p>The observations of Dr. Kennerly, if they are to be received as characteristic
of the Western Creepers, do not correspond with those of our Eastern
birds, as far as we have observed them. None of our birds are more easily
approached, and when they are pursuing their search for food, none are more
regardless of observation. The statement that our Creeper, when watched,
moves to the opposite side of the tree from the looker-on, has found a certain
currency in our books. We are, however, of the opinion that this is owing
to its restless activity, prompting it to constant changes of place and position,
and not to its timidity or caution. We have uniformly found them either
unconscious or regardless of our near presence.</p>

<p>They are solitary in their habits, and frequent, especially in the summer,
deep woods, searching for their favorite food in high places where it is difficult
to reach them, but this is no necessary evidence of their shyness. They
often hunt for their food in very exposed places, with equal courage and
recklessness. It is an active, restless bird, associating with Titmice and the
smaller Woodpeckers, moving with great rapidity from side to side and from
place to place. They breed in hollow trees, in the deserted holes of the Woodpeckers,
and in the decayed stumps and branches of trees. Their nest is a
loose aggregation of soft, warm materials, not interwoven, but simply collected
with regard to no other requisite than warmth.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1851 our party, in their visit to one of the smaller
Grand Menan Islands, was so fortunate as to meet with the nest of this bird.
It was built in a decayed birch-tree, only a few feet from the ground, and
contained five eggs nearly ready to hatch. This was on the 20th of June.
The nest was an intermingling of decayed wood, the fur of small quadrupeds,
and feathers, but with so little adherence or consistency of form that it was
impossible to retain the materials in position after removal.</p>

<p>So far from evincing any timidity, the birds refused to leave their nest, and
could hardly be prevented from following it when removed from the woods
to a house on the island. One of our companions, returning to the woods in
order to secure the birds for the sake of identification, found the pair still
lingering round the place of their rifled nest. Upon his approach they began
to circle round his head with reproachful cries, and continued to keep so
close to him that it was impossible to shoot one without mutilating it. At
length one of the birds alighted on a small branch held over his head by
a lad who accompanied him, and in this position was secured by shooting it
<!--171.png--><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span>
with a pistol loaded with the finest shot. Its mate could have been secured,
as she persisted in pursuing them, but she was not molested. Throughout
there was not a trace of timidity on the part of either bird, but the most
reckless and daring devotion.</p>

<p>Besides the single call-note or the sharp outcry with which the Creepers
signalize their movements, and which they utter from time to time as they
rapidly and busily move up and down the trunks and limbs, or flit from tree
to tree, they have been generally regarded as having no song. But this is not
the fact. The careful observations of Mr. William Brewster of Cambridge
have satisfied him that these birds have a very distinct and varied song. During
the winter these birds are not uncommon in the vicinity of Boston, coming
about the houses with all the tameness and confidence of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parus atricapillus</i>,
and permit a very near approach. They are very easily attracted by suspending
from a piazza a piece of fat meat. Mr. Brewster has observed them
commence singing as early as the 14th of March. Their notes are varied
and warbling and somewhat confused; some of them are loud, powerful, and
surpassingly sweet, others are more feeble and plaintive; their song usually
ends with their accustomed cry, which may be represented by <i class="birdcall">crēē-crēē-crē-ēp</i>.
Mr. Brewster, besides repeatedly hearing them sing in Massachusetts
in the early spring, has also listened to their song in Maine in the month of
June.</p>

<p>Their eggs are small in proportion to the size of the bird, are nearly oval
in shape, with a grayish-white ground, sparingly sprinkled with small, fine,
red and reddish-brown spots. They measure .55 by .43 of an inch.</p>

Ground-color above very dark sepia-brown, each feather with a sharply
defined medial streak of grayish-white, these streaks becoming broader posteriorly, where
they are discontinued at the beginning of the rump. Whole rump and upper tail-coverts
chestnut-rufous. Beneath pale ashy, becoming almost white on the throat; crissal feathers
deep ochraceous except at the tips, which are whitish. Markings of the wings as
usual. Measurements (8176, Mexico): wing, 2.50; tail, 2.70; bill (from nostril), .48;

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Guatemala and Mexico; probably extending along the table-lands into the
United States.</p>

<p>This is one of the best marked of the various races that have been discussed
(see <a href="#Page_124"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 124</a>). The ground-color of the upper parts is altogether darker
than in any of the others, and the streaks are more sharply defined and narrower;
<!--172.png--><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 129]</span>
the rufous of the rump is of a castaneous, instead of yellowish cast;
the wings appear more uniform with the back, owing to the dark color of the
latter, and their pale markings have little of that yellowish tinge so noticeable
in the others. In the ashy tinge of the lower parts there is a resemblance
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">familiaris</i> of Europe; but the latter has not the ochraceous crissum
so noticeable in the present bird. There is little resemblance to Western
and Rocky Mountain specimens of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. americana</i> and if these are to
be considered as separable from the Eastern (which, however, would not, in
our opinion, be advisable) they must not be referred to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mexicana</i>.</p>

<p>The Mexican Creeper is introduced here on account of the probability of
its occurrence in the Southern Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Mr. Salvin found the Mexican Tree-Creeper by no means uncommon
in the pine forests of the upper zone of the Volcan de Fuego. He
also observed it frequenting pine-trees in the district of Chilasco, Vera Paz,
at about 6,000 feet above the sea.</p>

<h2><span class="sc">Family</span> <b class="birdname">TROGLODYTIDÆ</b>.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Wrens.</span></h2>

<p class="p2 small"><abbr title="Characteristics"><span class="sc">Char.</span></abbr>
Rictal bristles wanting; the loral feathers with bristly points; the frontal
feathers generally not reaching to nostrils. Nostrils varied, exposed or not covered by
feathers, and generally overhung by a scale-like membrane. Bill usually without notch
(except in some Middle American genera). Wings much rounded, about equal to tail,
which is graduated. Primaries ten, the first generally about half the second. Basal joint
of middle toe usually united to half the basal joint of inner, and the whole of that of the
outer, or more. Lateral toes about equal, or the outer a little the longer. Tarsi scutellate.</p>

<p>The impossibility of defining any large group of animals, so as to separate
it stringently and abruptly from all others, is well understood among naturalists;
and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Troglodytidæ</i> form no exception to the rule. Some bear so
close a resemblance to the Mocking Thrushes as to have been combined with
them; while others again exhibit a close approximation to other subfamilies.
The general affinities of the family, however, appear to be to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdidæ</i>,
and one of the best characters for separating the two families appears to exist
in the structure of the feet.</p>

<p>In the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdidæ</i> the basal joint of the outer lateral toe is united to the
middle toe, sometimes only a part of it; and the inner toe is cleft almost to
its very base, so as to be opposable to the hind toe, separate from the others.
In the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Troglodytidæ</i>, on the contrary, the inner toe is united by half its basal
joint to the middle toe, sometimes by the whole of this joint; and the second
joint of the outer toe enters wholly or partially into this union, instead of
the basal joint only. In addition to this character, the open, exposed nostrils,
the usually lengthened bill, the generally equal lateral toes, the short
rounded wings, the graduated tail, etc., furnish points of distinction.</p>

Bill stout, compressed, as long as, or longer than the head, without notch
or rictal bristles; culmen and commissure
curved; gonys nearly straight.
Nostrils in the antero-inferior part of
nasal groove, in advance of the frontal
feathers, with an overhanging scale
with thickened edge, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thryothorus</i>;
sometimes, as in the type, reduced
to a slight ridge along the upper
side of the nasal groove. Lateral septum
not projecting below or anteriorly
into the nasal cavity, but concealed
by the nasal scale. Tarsus a little
longer than middle toe and claw;

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Brown-headed Creeper is a comparatively recent addition
to the fauna of the United States,
but appears to be common along
the southwestern borders of the
United States, from the valley of
the Rio Grande to San Diego, in
California. In Lower California
it is replaced by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. affinis</i>.</p>

<p>It was first added to our avifauna
by Mr. Lawrence in 1851,
on the strength of a specimen
obtained in Texas by Captain
McCown.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann, in his paper on
the Birds of California, speaks
of finding it in the arid country back of Guymas, on the Gulf of California.
This country, presenting only broken surfaces and a confused
mass of volcanic rocks, covered by a scanty vegetation of thorny bushes
and cacti, among other interesting birds, was found to contain this species
in abundance. He describes it as a lively, sprightly species, uttering, at
intervals, clear, loud, ringing notes. Its nest, composed of grasses and lined
with feathers, was in the shape of a long purse, enormous for the size of the
bird, and laid flat between the forks or on the branches of a cactus. The
<!--176.png--><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 133]</span>
entrance was a covered passage, varying from six to ten inches in length.
The eggs, six in number, he described as being of a delicate salmon-color,
very pale, and often so thickly speckled with ash and darker salmon-colored
spots as to give quite a rich cast to the whole surface of the egg.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Couch met with these birds near Monterey. He states that
they have a rich, powerful song. Of the nest he gives substantially the
same description as that furnished by Dr. Heermann.</p>

<p>The eggs are of an oblong-oval shape, slightly more pointed at one end,
and are so equally and generally covered, over a white ground, with fine
salmon-colored spots, as to present a uniform and almost homogeneous
appearance. They vary in length from an inch to 1.02 inches, and have
an average breadth of .68 of an inch.</p>

Cap of head reddish-brown; the concealed centres of feathers dusky.
Rest of upper parts grayish-brown, all the feathers of body and scapulars with broad central
or shaft streaks of whitish edged with black; the streaks irregular in outline, on some
feathers nearly linear, in others widening at intervals along the shaft. Outer webs of the
wing-feathers crossed by about seven rows of whitish semicircular spots, with corresponding
series of more circular ones on the inner web. Tail-feathers black, all of them with a
series of about eight quadrate white spots on each web, which are alternate to each other,
not opposite, and extend from or near the black shaft to the edge; the extreme tips of the
feathers black; the two central feathers, however, more like the back, with irregular mottling
of grayish and black. Upper tail-coverts barred transversely with black.</p>

<p class="small">Under parts white, faintly tinged with rusty posteriorly; each feather spotted with
black, excepting on the immaculate chin. These spots are rather larger and more quadrate
on the jugulum, where they are sometimes on the sides of the feathers (on one
or both sides); posteriorly, however, they are elongated or tear-shaped, and strung along
the shaft, one or two on each. On the crissum they are large and much rounded, three or
four on each longer feather. Legs rather dusky. Bill lead-color, pale at the base below;
iris reddish-brown. A broad white stripe from bill over the eye and nape; edged
above and below with black; line behind the eye like the crown; cheek-feathers white,
edged with blackish.</p>

<p class="small">Immature specimens exhibit a tendency to a whitish spotting in the ends of the feathers
of the cap. A very young bird does not, however, differ materially, except in having the
spots less distinct beneath, the white streaks less conspicuous above, the white of the
wings soiled with rufous. Specimens vary considerably in the proportional as well as
absolute thickness and length of the bill; thus, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 32,167 measures .80 from nostril to end

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Only observed at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, Lower California.</p>

<p>This species is most nearly allied to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. brunneicapillus</i>; the most apparent
difference at first sight being in the greater concentration of black on the
throat and jugulum in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">brunneicapillus</i>, and the much smaller size of the
remaining spots on the under parts, with the decided light-cinnamon of
the posterior portion of the body. The outer and central tail-feathers alone
are marked as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. affinis</i>, the intermediate ones being entirely black, with
the exception of a white subterminal band.</p>

<p>This is one of the most characteristic birds constituting the isolated fauna
of Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas. Like nearly all the species peculiar to this remarkable
locality, it is exceedingly abundant, breeding in immense numbers. It has
not yet been detected elsewhere, though it may possibly be found on the
Lower Colorado.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This recently described species was first discovered by Mr.
Xantus, and has, so far as is known, a somewhat restricted locality, having
been met with only at the southern extremity of Lower California, where it
is an exceedingly abundant bird. Mr. Xantus has published no observations
in regard to its habits, which, however, are probably very nearly identical
with those of the more common species. From the brief memoranda given
by him in the general register of his collections, made at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, we
gather that their nests were built almost exclusively in opuntias, cacti, and
the prickly pear, and were generally only four or five feet from the ground,
but occasionally at the height of ten feet.</p>

<p>The nests are large purse-shaped collections of twigs and coarse grasses,
very similar to, and hardly distinguishable in any respect from, those of the
more northern species. The eggs vary from 1.05 to 1 inch in length, and
from .65 to .70 of an inch in breadth, and have a reddish-white ground very
uniformly dotted with fine markings of reddish-brown, purple, and slate.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Rock Wren, so far as its distribution is known, is principally
restricted to the high central plains of the Rocky Mountains, from Nebraska
to the coast ranges near the Pacific, and from Oregon to Mexico and Lower
California. According to Dr. Cooper it is an abundant species throughout
the dry, rocky, and barren districts of California, especially in the southern
portions, where it comes nearer the coast. They are numerous among the
plains on both sides of the Rocky Mountains. Their favorite places are
among the rocks, where they are always busily engaged in hunting for insects
in the crevices. Dr. Cooper found nests at San Diego in cavities under the
tiled roofs of houses, but they all contained young as early as May. At
Fort Mojave they began to sing in February, and their song continued
throughout the spring. They range to a high elevation among the mountains,
<!--179.png--><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 136]</span>
having been found by Dr. Newberry at Klamath Lake in Oregon. Dr.
Cooper does not describe their song, but Dr. Heermann speaks of it as only a
very weak trill. The latter met with them in the mountainous districts of
California, where they were searching
for their food among the crevices of
the rocks. He afterwards met with
them in New Mexico and Texas.
They were quite abundant in the Tejon
Valley, passing in and out, among
and under the boulders profusely scattered
over the mountains, searching
for spiders, worms, and small insects,
in pursuit of which they uttered at
intervals a loud and quick note of a
peculiarly thrilling character. Lieutenant
Couch found them in the sandstone
ranges near Patos, in the province of Coahuila. Some of their habits
are spoken of as sparrow-like, and, while they have the usual wren-like
grating noises, they also possess a song of great variety and sweetness.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly met with them among the bushes in the vicinity of the Rio
Grande. Their flight he describes as short, the bird generally soon alighting
on the ground and running off very rapidly.</p>

<p>This Wren was first discovered by Mr. Say near the Arkansas River, inhabiting
a sterile district devoid of trees, hopping along the ground or flitting
through the low, stunted junipers on the banks of the river, usually in small
flocks of five or six. Nuttall afterwards found them in July on the Western
Colorado. The note of the female was <i class="birdcall">charr-charr-te-aigh</i>, with a strong
guttural accent, and with a shrill call similar to the note of the Carolina
Wren. The old birds were feeding a brood of five young, which, though full
grown, were cherished with querulous assiduity. He found them nesting
among the rocky ledges, in the crevices of which they hide themselves
when disturbed. Mr. Nuttall also met with this species near Fort Vancouver.
Mr. Salvin states that in several instances it has been met with in
Guatemala.</p>

<p>The eggs of this Wren obtained by Dr. Palmer in Arizona have a clear
white ground, sparingly spotted with well-defined, distinct dottings of brownish-red.
These are chiefly distributed around the larger end. They vary
somewhat in size and shape, some being of a more rounded form, though all
have one end more pointed than the other. The length is pretty uniform,
.77 of an inch. The breadth varies from .60 to .66 of an inch. They are
larger and more oblong than the eggs of any other Wren, except perhaps the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mexicanus</i>, and bear little resemblance to any other eggs of this family with
which I am acquainted, except those of the Winter Wren, and the egg attributed
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. americanus</i>.</p>

<p><!--180.png--><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 137]</span>
The nest is homogeneous in structure, composed entirely of thin strips of
reddish-colored bark and fine roots, interspersed with a few small bits of
wool. It is distorted by packing, so that measurements of it would be
valueless; its dimensions in its pressed condition are: diameter, 5 inches;
depth, 2 inches. The cavity is shallow and saucer-shaped.</p>

<p>From Mr. Ridgway we learn that from the summit of the Sierra Nevada
eastward, as far as the party explored, he found this Wren universally distributed.
In the middle provinces of the Rocky Mountains it was the most
abundant species of the family, but was not so abundant in the Wahsatch
Mountains. The general resort of this species was among rocky or stony
hill-slopes, though it was not confined to such localities. At Carson City
he found it particularly partial to the rubbish of the decaying pine-logs. At
Virginia City it was the only Wren seen frequenting the old buildings and
abandoned mining-shafts, in its predilection for such places reminding him
very much of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thryothorus ludovicianus</i>, which in its manners it very
strongly resembles.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway noticed a wonderful variety in the notes of this Wren. Its
peculiarly guttural <i class="birdcall">turee</i> was repeatedly heard, and its song in spring had
a slight resemblance in modulation to that of the Carolina Wren, though
altogether lacking the power and richness so characteristic of the superb song
of that bird. Frequently its song was changed into a prolonged monotonous
trill, similar to the tremulous spring-call of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Junco hyemalis</i>.</p>

<p>This species is not so wary as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catherpes mexicanus</i>. Upon suddenly
starting up an individual of this kind, he would fly to the nearest boulder,
turn with his breast towards the party, swing oddly from side to side, all the
while ludicrously bowing and scolding the intruder with his peculiar sharp
expressions of displeasure.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper, in his paper on the Fauna of the Territory of Montana, states
that he observed this bird occasionally through the main Rocky Mountain
chain to near the crossing of the Bitterroot, but it was less common than
among the cliffs and rocks of the barren plain along their eastern slope.
Though he did not find it in the western part of Washington Territory, he
has no doubt that it frequents parts of the rocky cañons of the Columbia
Plain. A nest with nine eggs was found in a log-cabin below Fort Benton.</p>

<p>The above characters apply to all specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catherpes</i> from north of
Mexico, as substantiated by a sufficient series in the collection. It is a
remarkable fact that this northern race should be so much smaller than the
Mexican one, especially in view of the fact that it is a resident bird in even
the most northern parts of its ascertained habitat.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The geographical distribution of this race of the White-throated
Wren, so far as known, is confined to the line of the United States and
Mexican boundary, extending northward up the Valley of the Colorado, as
far as Western Nevada. The corresponding Mexican race reaches some
distance southward, but has not yet been detected beyond the limits of
Mexico. The habits of both races, however, are quite similar, as far as
known.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann first met with this Wren in the spring of 1851, on the
Cosumnes River. In the following year he procured three specimens on the
Calaveras River. He describes it as an active, sprightly bird, having a loud
and pleasing song that may be heard a great distance, and which it repeats
at short intervals. When found, it was occupied with searching for insects,
between and under the large boulders of rock that, in some portions of the
river, are thrown together in confused masses, as if by some terrific convulsion
of nature.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly also met with this species in similar localities among the
hills bordering upon the Big Sandy, where the rocks are also described
<!--183.png--><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 140]</span>
as piled up thick and high. They were darting from rock to rock and
creeping among the crevices with great activity, constantly repeating their
peculiar and singular note. The great rapidity of their motions rendered
it difficult to procure a specimen. He did not observe this bird anywhere
else.</p>

<p>Their occurrence equally in such wild and desolate regions and in the midst
of crowded cities indicates that the abundance of their food in either place,
and not the absence or presence of man, determines this choice of residence.
When first observed they were supposed to nest exclusively in deep and inaccessible
crevices of rocks, where they were not likely to be traced. Mr.
H. E. Dresser afterwards met with its nest and eggs in Western Texas, though
he gives no description of either. He found this species rather common near
San Antonio, where it remained to breed. One pair frequented a printing-office
at that place, an old half-ruined building, where their familiar habits
made them great favorites with the workmen, who informed him that the
previous spring they had built a nest and reared their young in an old wall
close by, and that they became very tame. At Dr. Heermann’s rancho on
the Medina he procured the eggs of this bird, as well as those of the
Louisiana and Bewick’s Wren, by nailing up cigar-boxes, with holes cut in
front, wherever these birds were likely to build.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumichrast describes its nest<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_29" id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span> as very skilfully wrought with spiders’
webs, and built in the crevices of old walls, or in the interstices between the
tiles under the roofs of the houses. A nest with four eggs, supposed to be
those of this species, was obtained in Western Texas by Mr. J. H. Clark; it
was cup-shaped, not large, and with only a slight depression. The eggs,
four in number, were unusually oblong and pointed for eggs of this family,
and measured .80 by .60 of an inch, with a crystalline-white ground, profusely
covered with numerous and large blotches of a reddish or cinnamon
brown.</p>

<p>So far as the observations of Mr. Ridgway enabled him to notice this bird,
he found it much less common than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salpinctes obsoletus</i>, and inhabiting
only the most secluded and rocky recesses of the mountains. Its common
note of alarm is described as a peculiarly ringing <i class="birdcall">dīnk</i>. It has a remarkably
odd and indescribably singular chant, utterly unlike anything else Mr.
Ridgway ever heard. This consisted of a series of detached whistles, beginning
in a high fine key, every note clear, smooth, and of equal length,
each in succession being a degree lower than the preceding one, and only
ending when the bottom of the scale is reached. The tone is soft, rich,
and silvery, resembling somewhat the whistling of the Cardinal Grosbeak.</p>

<p>It was often seen to fly nearly perpendicularly up the face of a rocky wall,
and was also noticed to cling to the roof of a cave with all the facility of a
true Creeper.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Great Carolina or Mocking Wren is found in all the Southeastern
and Southern States from Florida to Maryland, and from the Atlantic
to Kansas and the Valley of the Rio Grande. It is not common about Washington,
but is much more abundant in the Southern States. Occasionally it
has been found as far north as Philadelphia,
and in one or two instances near New York,
where Mr. Lawrence has twice seen it, and
where on one occasion it appeared to be breeding.
Dr. Woodhouse found it very abundant
throughout Texas and the Indian Territory.
It is also abundant, and resident, in Southern
Illinois, as far north as latitude 38<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> 20<abbr title="minutes">′</abbr> 20<abbr title="seconds">″</abbr>.</p>

<p>The habits and movements of this species,
as described by those who have had the
best opportunities for observing it, correspond
with those of the whole family of
Wrens. Its flight is usually only in short
distances, and is accompanied with short flappings
of the wings, and violent jerkings of
the body and the tail. The latter is usually kept erect. It moves with
quick jerks, and with sharp, rapid notes uttered as if in anger. It is in sight
one moment and out the next, passes in at one place and out at another
<!--188.png--><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span>
with the rapidity of thought. Mr. Audubon often saw it singing from the
roof of an abandoned flat-boat, near New Orleans, and when its song was
ended it would creep from one board to the next, enter an augur-hole at
one place to reappear at another, catching numerous spiders and other insects
all the while.</p>

<p>Occasionally its movements are like those of a Creeper, ascending to the
upper branches of trees of a moderate height, or climbing a grapevine,
searching diligently among the leaves and in the crevices of the bark for
insects.</p>

<p>This species possesses a great variety and power of song. It is also said
to have and to exhibit remarkable powers of imitation, with a great variety
in its appropriated notes of other birds, giving, with modulations, the hoarse
rattle of the Kingfisher, the lively notes of the Tufted Titmouse, the simple
refrain of the Ground Robin, with those of the Grakles, the Meadow Lark,
the Bluebird, and others. Like the common Wren, the Carolina generally
builds its nest in the hollow of some tree or stump, or any other convenient
cavity. At other times it constructs its own habitation without any other
protection than the thick branches of a vine or shrub. In these situations
they are long and deep, and have an artificial roofing, often separate from the
nest itself. The materials employed in their construction are hay, grasses,
leaves, feathers, horse-hair, and dry fibres of the long Spanish moss. They
are softly and warmly lined with fur, hair, and feathers. The nest is not
unfrequently five or six inches in depth, while the opening is not large
enough to admit more than one bird at a time. They sometimes raise three
broods in a season.</p>

<p>It breeds as far north as Philadelphia, Mr. Audubon having found its nest
in a swamp in New Jersey, opposite that city.</p>

<p>Although seemingly studious of concealment, and shy and retiring in its
habits, Nuttall frequently observed it in Tuscaloosa and other large towns
in Alabama, appearing on the tops of barns and out-houses, singing with
great energy.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper, who enjoyed a favorable opportunity of watching these birds
in Florida, in the spring and summer of 1859, found a nest of this Wren in
the middle of March. It was built in a small box on a shelf in a mill, and
was about four feet from the ground. It was arched over at the top, though
this was not necessary to shelter it. This covering was formed of shavings,
with a few small sticks and straws. Four eggs were laid. The birds were
very tame, and were not alarmed by the loud noise of the mill, nor by a cat
almost always present. Another nest found by Dr. Cooper was built in a
small hole in the trunk of a tree, not more than six inches from the ground.
This nest was not arched over. Its close proximity to a dwelling-house
alone protected it from wild animals.</p>

<p>The eggs of this Wren are usually six or seven in number, and vary in size
and shape. They are for the most part of a spheroidal-oval shape, though
<!--189.png--><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 144]</span>
some are more oblong than others. Their length varies from .75 to .70 of an
inch, and their greatest breadth from .60 to .65. The ground-color is a reddish-white,
profusely covered with blotches of purple, slate, reddish-brown,
and red. These are generally and pretty equally diffused, and are not more
abundant at the larger end than elsewhere.</p>

<p>There are three strongly marked geographical
varieties of “Bewick’s Wren,” separable
by quite constant characters. Of these the
Mexican (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">leucogaster</i>) and the typical form
from eastern North America (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bewickii</i>) differ
most in coloration, while the western (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spilurus</i>)
is intermediate in this respect, but with
a longer bill than in the other two. The peculiarities
of the three forms are expressed
on <a href="#Page_141">page 141</a>.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern Province of United States.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This interesting species of Wren was first met with by Audubon
in Louisiana. A number of individuals were observed at the time, but nothing
of its history was known for several years afterward. In shape, color,
and habits it most resembled the Carolina Wren, but was less rapid in movement,
and not so lively. Fourteen years later Dr. Bachman again met with
birds of this species, in 1835, at the Salt Sulphur Springs of Virginia. They
comprised a family of two parents and five young, nearly full grown. Their
notes were like those of the Winter Wren, neither louder nor more connected.
They seemed of restless habit, creeping actively among fences, stumps, and
logs. One ascended an oak, nearly to the top, in the manner of a Creeper.
This species proved to be quite common in that locality, and to be the
only Wren abundant among the mountains. Dr. Gibbs detected it near
Columbia, <abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>, and Dr. Trudeau afterwards found it quite common in
Louisiana.</p>

<p>It was first observed breeding by Professor Baird in Carlisle, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>,
in 1844. In all respects the nests and their location corresponded with
those of the common Wren. Dr. Woodhouse found it very abundant in the
Indian Territory, and describes its habits as similar to those of other Wrens.
Lieutenant Couch observed this Wren at Santa Rosalio in Mexico, early in
March. It was seeking its food among the low prickly-pears. He was
informed that they deposited their eggs wherever they could do so without
making much of a nest, inside the cabins under the rafters, but in New
Leon he found one of its nests quite elaborately constructed in a thatched
roof. He describes the song as quite varied, and one of the sweetest that
he heard in that country.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Gerhardt of Varnell’s Station, <abbr title="Georgia">Ga.</abbr>, met with this species
among the mountainous portions of Northern Georgia, where it generally
nested in holes in stumps. In one instance the nest was constructed five
inches in length, and four in diameter, with a cavity two inches in depth, and
the walls of great proportionate thickness, made externally of coarse roots,
<!--191.png--><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span>
finer on the inside, and lined with various kinds of animal fur and with
feathers. Both birds worked together in constructing their nest, beginning
on the 11th of April, and on the 27th of the same month this contained
seven eggs. The nest was not covered at the top, in the manner of the
Carolina Wren. In the following season another pair commenced building
their nest in his bed, in a log-house. Driven from these impossible quarters,
they tried the same experiment in various other parts of the house, but only
to abandon it, and at last finished by making a successful attempt in the
hay-loft. Their visits to that portion of Georgia, he informed me, were
irregular and only occasional. In 1859 he had not met with any birds of
this species for the space of five years.</p>

<p>The eggs measure .67 by .50 of an inch in their average proportions,
resembling somewhat those of the Carolina Wren, but having a lighter
ground, with fewer and finer markings of slate and reddish-brown. The
ground-color is of a pinkish-white.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Boucard obtained specimens of these birds in the winter months,
in the State of Oaxaca, Mexico, probably of the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">leucogaster</i>.</p>

<p>We learn from Mr. Ridgway that in Southern Illinois (as far north as latitude
38<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> 20<abbr title="minutes">′</abbr> 20<abbr title="seconds">″</abbr>) this Wren is very abundant, and the most familiar species
of the family. In certain localities (as in the Valley of the Wabash) it
entirely replaces the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Troglodytes ædon</i>, the latter being wholly unknown. In
its habits it is even more familiar than that species, always preferring
the out-buildings, even in large towns, to the neighborhood of the woods,
and still further increases its attractions by possessing a charming song,
a real <em>song</em>, of sweet notes finely modulated, and uttered, generally, as
the bird perches upon a fence or the stable roof, its head thrown back,
and its long tail pendent as it sings. The confused, gabbling sputter of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. ædon</i>, uttered as it pauses just for an instant in its restless hopping
through the ivy, cannot be compared to the chant of liquid musical notes
of this species, which resembles more nearly, both in modulation and power,
that of the Song Sparrow (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melospiza melodia</i>), though far superior to it.
On ordinary occasions the note of Bewick’s Wren is a soft, low <i class="birdcall">plit</i>, uttered
as the bird hops about the fence or stable, its long tail carried upright, and
jerked to one side at each hop. In its movements it is altogether more
deliberate and less restless than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. ludovicianus</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Troglodytes ædon</i>,
neither of which it much resembles in motion, and still less in notes. The
nest of this Wren is usually built about the out-houses, a mortise-hole or
some well-concealed corner being generally selected. Old stables and ash-hoppers
are especially frequented as nesting-places. Mr. Ridgway found one
in the bottom of the conical portion of a quail-net which was hung up in a
shed, and another in a piece of stove-pipe which lay horizontally in the garret
of a smoke-house; another rested upon a flat board over the door of an
out-house, while a fourth was placed behind the weather-boarding of a building.
The nest is generally very bulky, though the bulk is regulated to suit
<!--192.png--><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 147]</span>
the size of the cavity in which the nest is placed. Its materials are usually
sticks, straws, coarse feathers, fine chips, etc., exteriorly fastened together
with masses of spider’s-webs, the lining being of finer and more downy materials,
generally soft spider’s-webs, tow, and especially the downy feathers of
barnyard fowls.</p>

<p>Young birds from all the localities differ from adults merely in having the
feathers of the throat and breast very narrowly and inconspicuously edged
with blackish.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This variety of Bewick’s Wren is exclusively an inhabitant of
the Western coast. According to Dr. Cooper, they abound throughout the
wooded parts of California and northward, frequenting the densest forests
as well as the open groves. During the winter they were found in the vicinity
of Fort Mojave, but left in April, probably for the mountains. They also
winter throughout the mild regions towards the coast as far north as Puget
Sound. They are known as Mocking-Wrens, though Dr. Cooper thinks they
do not really imitate other birds, but rather have a great variety of their own
notes, some of which resemble those of other birds and are well calculated
to deceive one unaccustomed to them. He was often led to search in vain
for some new form, which he thought he heard singing, only to find it to be
<!--193.png--><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 148]</span>
a bird of this species. Near San Diego, in April, 1862, he discovered one
of its nests built in a low bush, only three feet from the ground. It was
quite open above, formed of twigs, grass, etc., and contained five eggs just
ready to hatch, described as white with brown specks near the larger end.</p>

<p>Messrs. Nuttall and Townsend observed these birds in the marshy meadows
of the Wahlamet, accompanied by their young, as early as May. They seemed
to have all the habits of Marsh Wrens. Drs. Gambel and Heermann, who
observed them in California, describe them as keeping in low bushes and
piles of brush, as well as about old dead trees and logs, over and around
which they were flitting with the greatest activity, uttering, when approached,
the usual grating scold of the Wrens.</p>

<p>In Washington Territory Dr. Cooper states that this and the Winter Wren
are among the few birds that enliven the long rainy season with their songs,
which were as constantly heard in the dullest weather as in the sunny spring.
The young broods make their first appearance there in June. Dr. Suckley
found this species very abundant at Puget Sound, where it is a constant
resident throughout the year. On sunny days in January and in February
it was found among low thickets in company with the smaller species. At
this season they were very tame, allowing a person to approach them without
apparent fear. He speaks of the voice of the male as being harsh and loud
during the breeding-season, and not unlike that of the common House Wren.</p>

<p>In the Review of American Birds (p. 139), I have established a variety,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aztecus</i>, to embrace specimens from Mexico paler than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ædon</i>, and with a
brownish tinge on the breast, and smaller size.</p>

<p>There can scarcely be any doubt that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. americanus</i> of Audubon is
nothing more than this species in dark, accidentally soiled plumage (from
charcoal of burnt trees, etc.).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common House Wren is found
throughout the United States, from the Atlantic
to the Rocky Mountains, though it is not everywhere
equally abundant. Thus, while in some
parts of Massachusetts it occurs in considerable
numbers every year, in other portions not
twenty miles distant it is never seen. West of
the Rocky Mountains it is replaced by Parkman’s
Wren, which is rather a race than a distinct

species, the differences in plumage being very slight, and in habits,
nest, and eggs not appreciable, though Dr. Cooper thinks there is a difference
in their song. Another race or a closely allied species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. aztecus</i>, is
found in Mexico, near the borders of the United States, but does not have
an extended range. It is found in the winter in Guatemala.</p>

<p>This species does not appear to be found beyond the southwestern portion
of Maine and the southern portions of New Hampshire and Vermont. It
makes its first appearance in Washington early in April, and for a while is
very abundant, visiting very familiarly
the public grounds of the capitol,
private gardens, out-buildings, and the
eaves of dwellings. It does not appear
in the New England States until
after the first week in May, and leaves
for the South about the last of September.
It is not observed in any
portion of the United States after the
first of November.</p>

<p>The hollows of decaying trees, crevices
in rocks, or the centre of meshes
of interlacing vines, are their natural
resorts. These they readily relinquish
for the facilities offered in the society
of man. They are bold, sociable, confiding birds, and will enter into the
closest relations with those who cultivate their acquaintance, building
their nests from preference under the eaves of houses, in corners of the
wood-shed, a clothes-line box, olive-jars, martin-boxes, open gourds, an
old hat, the skull of an ox placed on a pole, the pocket of a carriage,
or even the sleeve of an old coat left hanging in an out-building. In the
spring of 1855 a pair of these Wrens nested within the house, and over
the door of the room of the late Robert Kennicott, where they raised
their broods in safety. They built a second nest on a shelf in the same
room, which they entered through a knot-hole in the unceiled wall. At
first shy, they soon became quite tame, and did not regard the presence
of members of the family. The male bird was more shy than his mate,
and though equally industrious in collecting insects would rarely bring
them nearer than the knot-hole, where the female would receive them.
The female with her brood was destroyed by a cat, but this did not deter
the male bird from appearing the following season with another mate and
building their nest in the same place. Another instance of a singular selection
of a breeding-place has been given by the same authority. Dr. Kennicott,
the father of Robert, a country physician, drove an old two-wheeled
open gig, in the back of which was a box, a foot in length by three inches
in width, open at the top. In this a pair of Wrens insisted, time after time,
<!--196.png--><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span>
in building their nest. Though removed each time the vehicle was used, the
pair for a long while persisted in their attempts to make use of this place, at
last even depositing their eggs on the bare bottom of the box. It was two
or three weeks before they finally desisted from their vain attempts.</p>

<p>Sometimes this bird will build a nest in a large cavity, holding perhaps a
bushel. Before the cup of the nest is completed, the birds will generally
endeavor to fill the entire space with sticks and various other convenient
substances. Where the entrance is unnecessarily large they will generally
contract it by building about it a barricade of sticks, leaving only a small
entrance. In the midst of these masses of material they construct a compact,
cup-shaped, inner nest, hemispherical in shape, composed of finer materials
and warmly lined with the fur of small quadrupeds, and with soft
feathers. If the eggs are taken as the female is depositing them, she will
continue to lay quite a long while. In one instance eighteen were taken,
after which the birds were let alone and raised a brood of seven.</p>

<p>During the months of May and June the male is a constant and remarkable
singer. His song is loud, clear, and shrill, given with great animation
and rapidity, the performer evincing great jealousy of any interruption, often
leaving off abruptly in the midst of his song to literally “pitch in” upon
any rival who may presume to compete with him.</p>

<p>If a cat or any unwelcome visitor approach the nest, angry vociferations
succeed to his sprightly song, and he will swoop in rapid flights across the
head or back of the intruder, even at the apparent risk of his life.</p>

<p>Where several pairs occupy the same garden, their contests are frequent,
noisy, and generally quite amusing. In their fights with other birds for the
possession of a coveted hollow, their skill at barricading frequently enables
the Wrens to keep triumphant possession against birds much more powerful
than themselves.</p>

<p>Their food is exclusively insectivorous, and of a class of destructive insects
that render them great benefactors to the farmer. Mr. Kennicott
ascertained that a single pair of Wrens carried to their young about a thousand
insects in a single day.</p>

<p>The young, when they leave their nest, keep together for some time, moving
about, an interesting, sociable, and active group, under the charge of their
mother, but industrious in supplying their own wants.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Wren, usually from seven to nine in number, are of a
rounded-oval shape, at times nearly as broad as long. Their ground-color is
white, but they are so thickly studded with markings and fine spots of reddish-brown,
with a few occasional points of purplish-slate, as to conceal their
ground. Their shape varies from nearly spherical to an oblong-oval, some
measuring .60 by .55 of an inch, others with the same breadth having a
length of .67 of an inch.</p>

<p>Under the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Troglodytes americanus</i>, or Wood Wren, Mr. Audubon
figured and described as a distinct species what is probably only a somewhat
<!--197.png--><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span>
larger and darker form of the present species, hardly distinct enough to be
treated even as a race. Mr. Audubon met with an individual near Eastport
in 1832. The young were following their parents through the tangled recesses
of a dark forest, in search of food. Others were obtained in the same
part of Maine, near Dennisville, where Mr. Lincoln informed Mr. Audubon
that this bird was the common Wren of the neighborhood, and that they bred
in hollow logs in the woods, but seldom approached farm-houses.</p>

<p>In the winter following, at Charleston, <abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>, Mr. Audubon again met individuals
of this supposed species, showing the same habits as in Maine, remaining
in thick hedges, along ditches in the woods, not far from plantations.
The notes are described as differing considerably from those of the House
Wren. It has not been seen by Mr. Boardman, though residing in the
region where it is said to be the common Wren. Professor Verrill mentions
it as a rare bird in Western Maine.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles S. Paine, of Randolph, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, is the only naturalist who has
met with what he supposes were its nest and eggs. The following is his
account, communicated by letter.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Wood Wren comes among us in the spring about the 10th or 15th
of April, and sings habitually as it skips among the brush and logs and
under the roots and stumps of trees. In one instance I have known it to
make its appearance in midwinter, and to be about the house and barn some
time. It is only occasionally that they spend the summer here (Central
Vermont). The nest from which I obtained the egg you now have, I found
about the first of July, just as the young were about to fly. There were five
young birds and one egg. The nest was built on the hanging bark of a decaying
beech-log, close under the log. A great quantity of moss and rotten
wood had been collected and filled in around the nest, and a little round hole
left for the entrance. The nest was lined with a soft, downy substance. I
have no doubt that they sometimes commence to breed as early as the middle
of May, as I have seen their young out in early June.”</p>

<p>Mr. Paine discredits the statement that they build their nests in holes in
the ground. The egg referred to by Mr. Paine is oval in shape, slightly more
pointed at one end, measuring .75 of an inch in length by .53 in breadth.
The ground is a dead chalky-white, over which are sprinkled a few very fine
dots of a light yellowish-brown, slightly more numerous at the larger end.
This egg, while it bears some resemblance to that of the Winter Wren, is
totally unlike that of the House Wren.</p>

<p>Although the differences between the eastern and western House Wrens,
as stated in the Birds of North America, are not very appreciable, yet
a comparison of an extensive series shows that they can hardly be considered
as identical. The general color of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parkmanni</i> above is paler and grayer,
and there is little or none of the rufous of the lower back and rump. The
bars on the upper surface are rather more distinct. The under parts are
more alike, as, while ædon sometimes has flanks and crissum strongly tinged
with rufous, other specimens are as pale as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. parkmanni</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most appreciable differences between the two are to be found
in the size and proportions of wing and tail. The wing in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parkmanni</i> is
quite decidedly longer than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ædon</i>, measuring, in males, 2.12 to 2.15, instead
of 2.00 to 2.05. This is due not so much to a larger size as to a greater
development of the primaries. The first quill is equal to or barely more
than half the second in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parkmanni</i>; and the difference between the longest
primary and the tenth amounts to .32 of an inch, instead of about .20 in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ædon</i>, where the first quill is nearly half the length of the third, and much
more than half the length of the second.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This western form, hardly distinguishable from the common
House Wren of the Eastern States, if recognized as a distinct species,
is its complete analogue in regard to habits, nest, eggs, etc. It was first
obtained by Townsend on the Columbia River, and described by Audubon in
1839. It has since been observed in various parts of the country, from the
Mississippi Valley to the Pacific Coast, and from Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas to Oregon.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper, in his Birds of Washington Territory, speaks of this Wren as
common about Puget Sound, where it appeared to be much less familiar than
our common Wren, though its habits and song seemed to be very similar. It
there frequented chiefly the vicinity of woods and piles of logs, neither
seeking nor dwelling in the vicinity of houses. It arrives there about the
20th of April. As observed about Vancouver in 1853, its song appeared to
Dr. Cooper different from that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. ædon</i>. He found one of their nests
built in a horse’s skull that had been stuck upon a fence. Dr. Suckley, who
observed these birds about Fort Steilacoom, describes their voice as harsh
and unmusical.</p>

<p><!--199.png--><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 154]</span>
Dr. Cooper has since observed them in California, and in the winter, in
the Colorado Valley, where they roosted at night under the eaves of the garrison
buildings. They make their appearance at San Francisco as early
as March 16, and nest at San Diego in April. He has found their nests
in hollow trees at various heights, from five to forty feet, all composed of a
floor and barricade of long dry twigs, grass, and bark, loosely placed, but so
interwoven as to leave only just space for the birds to squeeze in over them.
They are warmly lined with a large quantity of feathers. Their eggs he
gives as from five to nine in number.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Hepburn has furnished more full and exact information in
regard to this species. We give it in his own words.</p>

<p>“The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. parkmanni</i> is the common wren of Vancouver Island, far more
so than of California, where I have found the Bewick’s Wren (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. bewickii</i>)
much more numerous. Parkman’s Wren builds its nest in hollow trees in
Vancouver Island, about the middle of May, forming it of small sticks laid
at the bottom of the hole, neatly and comfortably lining it on the inside with
feathers that arch over the eggs. It will also readily avail itself of any
similar and equally convenient cavity. I have known these birds to build
under the roof of a frame house, entering by a hole between the topmost
board and the shingles; also in a hole in a gate-post, through which gate
people were continually passing; and also over a doorway, getting in by a
loose board, in a place where the nest could be reached by the hand. In
1852 I put a cigar-box, with a hole cut in one end, between the forks of a
tree in a garden at Victoria. A pair of Wrens speedily took possession of
it and formed their nest therein, laying seven eggs, the first on the 18th of
May. The eggs of this Wren are white, thickly freckled with pink spots,
so much so in some specimens as to give a general pink appearance to the
egg itself, but forming a zone of a darker hue near the larger end. They
are .81 of an inch in length by .50 in width.”</p>

<p>Their eggs resemble those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. ædon</i> so as to be hardly distinguishable,
yet on comparing several sets of each there seem to be these constant
differences. The spots of the western species are finer, less marked, more
numerous, and of a pinker shade of reddish-brown. The eggs, too, range a
little smaller in size, though exhibiting great variations. In one nest the
average measurement of its seven eggs is .60 by .50, that of another set of
the same number .70 by .50 of an inch.</p>

<p>In all respects, habits, manners, and notes, Parkman’s Wren is a perfect
counterpart of the eastern House Wren. In the country east of the Sierra
Nevada it almost wholly replaces the western Bewick’s Wren (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thryothorus
bewickii</i>, <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spilurus</i>), and inhabits any wooded localities, as little preference
being given to the cottonwoods of the river valleys as to the aspen groves
high up in the mountains.</p>

becoming brighter to the rump and tail; everywhere, except on the head and upper part
of the back, with transverse bars of dusky and of lighter. Scapulars and wing-coverts
with spots of white. Beneath pale reddish-brown, barred on the posterior half of the

<p>Western specimens may be separated as a variety <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pacificus</i> (<span class="sc">Baird</span>, Rev.
Am. Birds, 1864, 145), based on the much darker colors and the almost entire
absence of the whitish spots among the dark bars. The under parts are more
rufous; the tarsi are shorter, the claws larger, the bill straighter and more
slender.</p>

<p>The Winter Wren is very closely related to the common Wren (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. parvulus</i>,
<span class="sc">Koch</span>) of Europe, so much so, in fact, that the two almost seem to be
varieties of one species. The differences, as shown in a large series from
both continents, are the following: In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. parvulus</i> there is a tendency to
more uniform shades; and the prevailing tint anteriorly, beneath, is a pale
yellowish-ash, almost immaculate, instead of brownish-ochraceous, showing
minute specks and darker edges to the feathers. In extreme specimens of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. parvulus</i> the bars even on the tail and wings (except primaries, where
they are always distinct) are very obsolete, while on the lower parts they are
confined to the flanks and crissum. Sometimes, however, specimens of the
two are found which are almost undistinguishable from each other. In
fact, it is only by taking the plainer European birds and comparing them
with the darker American examples from the northwest coast, that the difference
between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. parvulus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. hyemalis</i> is readily appreciable.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Winter Wren, nowhere very abundant, seems to be distributed
over the whole of North America. Hardly distinguishable from
the common Wren of Europe, it can scarcely be considered as distinct.
The habits of our species certainly seem to be very different from those
assigned to the European bird, which in England appears to be as common
and as familiar a bird as even the Redbreast. The small size and retiring
habits of our species, as well as its unfrequent occurrence, and only in wild
places, combine to keep its history in doubt and obscurity. It is supposed
<!--201.png--><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 156]</span>
to be northern in its distribution during the breeding-season, yet only a
single specimen was obtained by Sir John Richardson, and that on the
northern shores of Lake Huron.</p>

<p>On the Pacific coast Dr. Cooper regarded the Winter Wren as the most
common species in the forests of Washington Territory, where it frequented
even the densest portions, and where its lively song was almost the only
sound to be heard. It was most commonly seen in winter, retiring in summer
to the mountains to breed. He observed young birds on the Coast
Mountains in July.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley also states that this Wren was found at Fort Steilacoom more
abundantly in the winter than any other species. It was very unsuspicious,
allowing a very near approach. The dense fir forests, among fallen logs,
were its usual places of resort during the long, damp, and dreary winters
of Oregon. Dr. Suckley regarded the habits of this species and those of
the Parkman Wren as nearly identical. Mr. Bischoff obtained four specimens
in Sitka.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon found this species at Eastport, on the 9th of May, in full
song and quite abundant. A month later he found them equally plentiful
in the Magdalen Islands, and afterwards, about the middle of July, in Labrador.
He described its song as excelling that of any bird of its size with
which he was acquainted, being full of cadence, energy, and melody, and as
truly musical. Its power of continuance is said to be very surprising.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the Winter Wren are those of the whole family.
They <a id="chg3" name="chg3"></a>move with rapidity and precision from place to place, in short, sudden
hops and flights, bending downward and keeping their tails erect. They
will run under a large root, through a hollow stump or log, or between the
interstices of rocks, more in the manner of a mouse than of a bird.</p>

<p>The writer has several times observed these Wrens on the steep sides of
Mount Washington, in the month of June, moving about in active unrest,
disappearing and reappearing among the broken masses of granite with
which these slopes are strewn. This was even in the most thickly wooded
portions. Though they evidently had nests in the neighborhood, they could
not be discovered. They were unsuspicious, could be approached within a
few feet, but uttered querulous complaints if one persisted in searching too
long in the places they entered.</p>

<p>This Wren, as I am informed by Mr. Boardman, is a common summer resident
near Calais, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr></p>

<p>Mr. Audubon met with its nest in a thick forest in Pennsylvania. He
followed a pair of these birds until they disappeared in the hollow of a protuberance,
covered with moss and lichens, resembling the excrescences often
seen on forest trees. The aperture was perfectly rounded and quite smooth.
He put in his finger and felt the pecking of the bird’s bill and heard its
querulous cry. He was obliged to remove the parent bird in order to see the
eggs, which were six in number. The parent birds made a great clamor as
<!--202.png--><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 157]</span>
he was examining them. The nest was seven inches in length and four and a
half in breadth. Its walls were composed of mosses and lichens, and were
nearly two inches in thickness. The cavity was very warmly lined with the
fur of the American hare and a few soft feathers. Another nest found on
the Mohawk, in New York, was similar, but smaller, and built against the
side of a rock near its bottom.</p>

<p>Mr. William F. Hall met with the nest and eggs of this bird at Camp
Sebois in the central eastern portion of Maine. It was built in an unoccupied
log-hut, among the fir-leaves and mosses in a crevice between the logs. It
was large and bulky, composed externally of mosses and lined with the fur
of hedge-hogs, and the feathers of the spruce partridge and other birds. It
was in the shape of a pouch, and the entrance was neatly framed with fine
pine sticks. The eggs were six in number, and somewhat resembled those of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parus atricapillus</i>. The female was seen and fully identified.</p>

<p>In this nest, which measured five and three quarters inches by five in
breadth, the size, solidity, and strength, in view of the diminutive proportions
of its tiny architect, are quite remarkable. The walls were two inches in
thickness and very strongly impacted and interwoven. The cavity was an
inch and a quarter wide and four inches deep. Its hemlock framework had
been made of green materials, and their strong and agreeable odor pervaded
the structure. The eggs measured .65 by .48 of an inch, and were spotted
with a bright reddish-brown and a few pale markings of purplish-slate, on a
pure white ground. Compared with the eggs of the European Wren their
eggs are larger, less oval in shape, and the spots much more marked in
their character and distinctness.</p>

rump almost black, streaked with white. Tail dusky, the feathers barred throughout with
brown (the color grayish on the under surface). Beneath white; the sides, upper part of

<p>There is a closely allied variety from Mexico and Guatemala (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. elegans</i>,
<span class="sc">Sclater &amp; Salvin</span>, Pr. Z. S., 1859, 8) which differs in the characters stated

<p>The differences between these two varieties are just barely appreciable
when specimens of the two, of corresponding seasons, are compared. Two
Mexican examples (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">elegans</i>) differ more from each other than one does
from North American specimens; because one (a typical specimen received
from Salvin) is in the worn, faded, midsummer plumage, and the other in the
perfect autumnal dress. Besides the longer tarsi of these Mexican birds,
their tails, and even their bills, are longer than seen in North American skins.
But while these differences between the North American and Mexican birds
are just appreciable, there is one from Brazil (51,017, <abbr lang="pt" xml:lang="pt" title="Senhor">Sr.</abbr> Don Fred. Albuquerque)
which is exactly intermediate between these two varieties in color,
while in size it is even smaller than the North American ones, measuring as
follows: wing, 1.60; tail, 1.60; culmen, .45, tarsus, .61.</p>

<p>Even if recognizable as belonging to different varieties, these specimens
are certainly all referable to one species.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Short-billed Marsh Wren is very irregularly distributed
throughout the United States, being found from Georgia to the British

Provinces, and from the Atlantic to the Upper Missouri. It is nowhere
abundant, and in many large portions of intervening territory has never
been found.</p>

 <p class="center small"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cistothorus palustris.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It is exclusively an inhabitant of low, fresh-water marshes, open swamps,
and meadows, is never found on high
ground, and is very shy and difficult of
approach. It makes its first appearance
in Massachusetts early in May, and leaves
early in September. In winter it has
been found in all the Gulf States, from
Florida to Texas.</p>

<p>According to Nuttall, this Wren has a
lively and quaint song, delivered earnestly
and as if in haste, and at short
intervals, either from a tuft of sedge or
from a low bush on the edge of a marsh.
When approached, the song becomes
harsher and more hurried, and rises
into an angry and petulant cry. In the early part of the season the male is
quite lively and musical. These Wrens spend their time chiefly in the long,
rank grass of the swamps and meadows searching for insects, their favorite
food.</p>

<p>Their nest is constructed in the midst of a tussock of coarse high grass,
the tops of which are ingeniously interwoven into a coarse and strong covering,
spherical in shape and closed on every side, except one small aperture
left for an entrance. The strong wiry grass of the tussock is also interwoven
with finer materials, making the whole impervious to the weather. The
inner nest is composed of grasses and finer sedges, and lined with soft, vegetable
down. The eggs are nine in number, pure white, and rather small for
the bird. They are exceedingly delicate and fragile, more so than is usual
even in the eggs of Humming-Birds. They are of an oval shape, and measure
.60 by .45 of an inch.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall conjectured that occasionally two females occupied the same
nest, and states that he has known the male bird to busy itself in constructing
several nests, not more than one of which would be used. As these birds
rear a second brood, it is probable that these nests are built from an instinctive
desire to have a new one in readiness for the second brood. This
peculiarity has been noticed in other Wrens, where the female sometimes
takes possession of the new abode, lays and sits upon her second set of eggs
before her first brood are ready to fly, which are left to the charge of her
mate.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon found this Wren breeding in Texas. Dr. Trudeau met them
on the marshes of the Delaware River, and their nest and eggs have been
sent to us from the Koskonong marshes of Wisconsin. It has also been found
<!--206.png--><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 161]</span>
in the marshes of Connecticut River, near Hartford; and in Illinois Mr. Kennicott
found it among the long grasses bordering on the prairie sloughs.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts I have occasionally met with their nests, but only late
in July, when the rank grass of the low meadows has been cut. These
were probably their second brood. The nest being built close to the ground,
and made of the living grasses externally, they are not distinguishable from
the unoccupied tussocks that surround them.</p>

<p><!--207.png--><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 162]</span>
The differences between these two races is much more appreciable than
those between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Troglodytes ædon</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. “parkmanni”</i>; the most striking
character is the much longer bill of the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">palustris</i>.</p>

<p>Specimens of the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paludicola</i> from the interior are paler and more
grayish-brown above, and have less distinct bars on the tail-coverts and tail,
than in Pacific coast specimens, while on the crown the brown, instead of
the black, largely predominates.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Marsh Wren appears to have a nearly unrestricted
range throughout North America. It occurs on the Atlantic coast from Massachusetts
to Florida, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and as far north
as Washington Territory on the west coast. A single specimen was procured
in Greenland. It is not, however, at all common in these more northern
latitudes. Mr. Drummond, of Sir John Richardson’s party, met with it in
the 55th parallel on the eastern declivity of the Rocky Mountains and in the
Saskatchewan Valley. Dr. Cooper found it early in March in the salt marshes
along the coast of Washington Territory, and thinks it winters in that section.
On the Eastern coast it is not common as far north as Massachusetts, a few
being found at Cambridge and in Barnstable County. It is abundant near
Washington, D. C., and throughout the country in all suitable locations south
and west from Pennsylvania. Mr. Ridgway found it plentiful in Utah.</p>

<p>They frequent low marshy grounds, whether near the sea or in the interior,
and build in low bushes, a few feet from the ground, a well-constructed
globular nest. On the Potomac, where the river is subject to irregular tides,
they are generally not less than five feet from the ground.</p>

<p>These nests are nearly spherical, and both in size and shape resemble a
cocoanut. They are made externally of coarse sedges firmly interwoven,
the interstices being cemented with clay or mud, and are impervious to
the weather. A small round orifice is left on one side for entrance, the upper
side of which is also protected from the rain by a projecting edge. The
inside is lined with fine grasses, feathers, the down of the silk-weed, and
other soft and warm vegetable substances. These birds arrive in the Middle
States early in May and leave early in September. They have two broods
in the season, and each time construct and occupy a new nest.</p>

<p>Audubon describes its nest as built among sedges, and as usually partly
constructed of the sedges among which the nest is built. This is the usual
manner in which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. stellaris</i> builds its nest, but I have never known
one of the present species building in this manner, and in the localities in
which they breed, near the coast, being subject to irregular heights of tides,
it could not be done with safety.</p>

<p>The note of the Marsh Wren is a low, harsh, grating cry, neither loud nor
musical, and more resembling the noise of an insect than the vocal utterances
of a bird.</p>

<p>Their food consists chiefly of small aquatic insects, minute mollusks,
and the like, and these they are very expert in securing.</p>

<p><!--208.png--><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span>
The eggs of this species average .65 of an inch in length and .50 in
breadth. They are, in color, in striking contrast with those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. stellaris</i>,
being so thickly marked with blotches and spots of a deep chocolate-brown
as to be almost of one uniform color in appearance. They are of an
oval shape, at times almost spheroidal, one end being but slightly more
pointed than the other. They number from six to nine.</p>

<p>In a few instances eggs of this species from the Mississippi Valley and
from California are of a light ashy-gray color, the markings being smaller
and of a much lighter color.</p>

<p>We have thus completed the account of the Oscine Singing-Birds with
slender bills not hooked at the end, and which have ten distinct primaries;
the first or outer one, however, either quite small or else considerably shorter
than the second. We now come to a series with only nine primaries, the
first being entirely wanting, and the second, now the outermost, nearly or
quite as long as the third. In the preliminary tables of general arrangement
will be found the comparative characters of the different families

<h2><span class="sc">Family</span> <b class="birdname">MOTACILLIDÆ</b>.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Wagtails.</span></h2>

<p class="p2 small"><abbr title="Characteristics"><span class="sc">Char.</span></abbr>
Bill slender, conical, nearly as high as wide at the base, with slight notch at the
tip; the culmen slightly concave above the anterior extremity of the nostrils; short bristles
at gape, which, however, do not extend forward to nostrils. Loral feathers soft and
dense, but with bristly points; nasal groove filled with naked membrane, with the elongated
nostrils in lower edge; the frontal feathers coming up to the aperture, but not directed
forward nor overhanging it. Wings lengthened and sharp-pointed; the primaries nine
(without spurious first), of which the first three to five, considerably longer than the
succeeding, form the tip; the exterior secondaries generally much emarginated at the
ends; the inner secondaries (so-called tertials) nearly equal to the longest primaries. The
tail rather narrow, emarginate. Tarsi lengthened, scutellate anteriorly only, the hind claw
usually very long, acute, and but slightly curved (except in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Motacilla</i>). Inner toe cleft
almost to the very base, outer adherent for basal joint only.</p>

<p>The combination of naked nostrils, notched bill, and nine primaries, with
the tarsi scutellate anteriorly only, will at once distinguish the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthinæ</i> of
this family from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alaudidæ</i>, which they so closely resemble in coloration,
habits, and lengthened hind claw. The lengthened, slightly curved hind
claw, much pointed wings, emarginated secondaries,&mdash;the inner ones nearly
as long as the primaries,&mdash;distinguish the family from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvicolidæ</i>, with
which also it has near relationships.</p>

<!--213.png--><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 166]</span>
North American fauna as an occasional visitant of Greenland, where in two
instances single specimens have been procured. It is found in all portions
of the European Continent, from the
islands of the Mediterranean as far north
as the Arctic regions. It appears in Sweden
in April, and leaves there in October.
Mr. Gould states also that it is found in
the northern portions of Africa, and in
the highlands of India. It also occurs,
though less frequently, in England, where
it is replaced by a local race, or an allied
species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Motacilla yarrelli</i> of Gould. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Motacilla alba</i> is said by Temminck to inhabit
meadows in the vicinity of streams
of water, villages, and old houses. Its food is chiefly insects in various stages
and of different kinds.</p>

<p>It builds its nest on the ground among the grass of the meadow, in fissures
in rocks or decayed buildings, among the roots of trees, on the banks of
streams, in piles of wood and fagots, or under the arch of a bridge. The
nests are somewhat coarsely constructed of interwoven dry bent stems of
plants and reeds, with a finer lining of the same. The eggs, six in number,
are of a bluish-white ground thickly sprinkled with fine dottings, which are
most usually of a blackish-brown color, sometimes ashy-gray or reddish-brown.</p>

<p>The Pied Wagtail, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. yarrelli</i>, Degland and Gerbe regard as a race, and
not a species. It has a limited habitat, confined to Norway, Sweden, and
the British Islands, in the latter of which it is a resident throughout the
year. Besides their difference in plumage, Mr. Yarrell has noticed certain
differences also of habit. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alba</i> is said not to be so partial to water as
the pied species, and though often found near ploughed land, does not, like
its kindred species, follow the plough in search of insects. Mr. Hewitson also
states that it has a hoarser voice.</p>

<p>Like all the birds of this family, the Wagtail is much admired for the elegance
of its form, its activity, and the airy lightness of its motions. It seems
ever on the move, runs with great rapidity a quick succession of steps in
pursuit of its food, and goes from place to place in short undulating flights.
It has a cheerful chirping note which it utters while on the wing. When it
alights, it gives a graceful fanning movement with its tail, from which it
derives its name.</p>

<p>The Pied Wagtail, whose habits have been more closely observed by English
naturalists, has frequently been seen to wade into the water in search of
aquatic insects, and probably also of small fish, as in confinement they have
been known to catch and feed on minnows in a fountain in the centre of their
aviary. It is probable that the habits of the White Wagtail are not dissimilar.</p>

<p><!--214.png--><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 167]</span>
They leave their breeding-places in October, collecting and moving in
small flocks.</p>

<p>Their eggs measure .79 of an inch in length and .59 in breadth. The
ground-color is of a grayish-white so thickly flecked with fine ash-colored
and black dots as to give the entire egg the effect of a uniform dark ashen
hue.</p>

<p>The recent discovery of a species
of yellow-bellied Wagtail in Norton
Sound, by the naturalists of the Russian
Telegraph Expedition, adds another
member of an Old World family
to the list of American birds.
Much confusion exists as to the precise
number of species in the genus,
some grouping together as varieties
what others consider as distinct species.
There is an unusual degree of
variation with age, sex, and season,
and this, combined with strongly
marked geographical peculiarities, renders
the proper solution of the problem impossible to any but those having
access to large series.</p>

Description of specimen <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 45,912, taken at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s, Norton Sound,
June 6, 1866, by H. M. Bannister. Above, including edges of upper tail-coverts, rich
olive-green, the top and sides of the head and neck pure ash-gray; chin and well-marked
stripe from nostrils over the eye to the nape, white; all under parts rich yellow, tinged with
olive on the sides. Stripe from corner of mouth through the eye, and involving the ear-coverts,
blackish-ash. Feathers of wings and tail dark brown; the coverts and secondaries
edged with olive (showing the obscure light wing-bars), the longest of the latter
edged externally with white; innermost quills edged externally with white. Outer three
quills nearly equal and longest (the prolonged secondaries as long), the others graduating
less. Outer tail-feathers and shaft white; the inner web edged externally with dusky,
<!--215.png--><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</span>
which, beginning at the base, runs out gradually to the edge, about half an inch from tip
of feathers; second feather with rather less white, and with a narrow line of brown along
the outer side of the shaft to within half
an inch of the tip. Bill and legs blackish.</p>

<p class="small">A second specimen (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 45,910) differs
in having ashy color of head obscured
with olivaceous-brown; and the yellow
on breast showing brownish bases. The
light markings on the wings more distinct and whiter.</p>

<p class="small">Another bird (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 45,913), taken on shipboard, about ninety miles west of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Matthew’s
Island, Behring’s Sea, August 10, 1866, appears to be of the same species, in
autumnal dress. Here the upper colors are more brown; the lower parts yellowish-white
tinged with brownish-fulvous across the breast and flank. Kamtschatkan specimens of the
same stage of plumage are very similar.</p>

<p>I am unable to distinguish this species from the Protean <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Budytes flava</i> of
Europe and Asia. Many different races appear to be found throughout this
wide circle of distribution, many of them more or less local, but the proportions
and general character are the same in all, and the general tendency
appears to be to unite all into one species. The sexes and ages of all the
species, real or supposed, vary very much, and, in the absence of a large
series, I can throw no light upon the obscurities of the subject. I cite
above the latest general work on the birds of Europe, in which will be
found the principal synonymes.</p>

<p>The specimens from Alaska submitted for examination to Mr. H. B. Tristram
were identified by him as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">B. flava</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Gray-headed Wagtail of Europe finds a place in the fauna

and where it is, at least, an occasional visitant. It is not a common bird of
the British Islands, where it is replaced by a closely allied species. Only
seven or eight instances of its occurrence were known to Mr. Yarrell.</p>

<p>On the continent of Europe it is quite an abundant species, inhabiting wet
springy places in moist meadows, and frequenting the vicinity of water and
the gravelly edges of rivers. It is numerous in all the central portions of
Europe. It has also an extensive northern and eastern geographical range,
appearing in Norway and Sweden as early as April and remaining there
until September. Linnæus met with it in Lapland on the <abbr title="twenty-second">22d</abbr> of May. It
occurs in Algeria, Nubia, and Egypt. Mr. Gould has received it from the
Himalayas, and Temminck gives it as a bird of Japan.</p>

<p>According to Degland, this bird is a very abundant species in France,
<!--216.png--><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 169]</span>
where it nests on the ground in the cornfields, in open fields, meadows, and
amidst the standing grain. It lays from four to six eggs, of a brownish-yellow
on a reddish-white ground, profusely covered with fine dots of reddish-gray,
which are more or less confluent. A few zigzag lines of dark brown
or black are found on the larger end. They measure .63 of an inch in length
and .55 in breadth. Its food is flies, moths, small green caterpillars, and
aquatic insects.</p>

<p>Ray’s Wagtail, recognized by some authors as a distinct species, is probably
only an insular race, chiefly found in the British Islands and in Western
France. In the latter place both birds occur, and here also they have been
known to mate the one with the other. Their nests and eggs are so alike
as not to be distinguishable. The former are constructed of fine fibrous
roots and fine stems of grasses, and are lined with hair.</p>

<p>These birds are remarkably social, collecting in small flocks soon after
leaving their nests, and until their autumnal migrations following the older
birds in quest of food. They have two call-notes which are quite shrill, and
are repeated in succession, the second being lower in tone. No mention is
made by the naturalists of the Telegraph Expedition of their having any song
other than these notes.</p>

<p>Mr. Bannister first observed this species at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s, on the 9th or 10th
of June, and from that time until late in August they were among the most
abundant of the land-birds. During the month of June he observed them
in flocks of twenty or thirty individuals. It seemed to be a rather shy bird.
He described its flight as like that of our common Goldfinch, rising with a
few strokes of its wings, then closing them and describing a sort of paraboloidal
curve in the air. The only note which he heard and identified as
uttered by this species was a kind of faint chirp, hardly to be called a song.
These birds seemed to prefer the open country, and were rarely observed in
the low brush, the only approach to woods found on the island.</p>

<p>Spring specimens from Labrador, collected by Dr. Coues, have the upper
parts ashy without any tinge of
olive, almost bluish on the head;
the lower parts deeper and more
reddish-buff than in autumnal
and winter specimens. Tarsi
black in spring, brown in winter;
toes always black.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> At different seasons
of the year the Brown Titlark
is found throughout the continent,
and abundant for the time
in the several parts of the country,
chiefly frequenting the least
cultivated portions and apparently
preferring the sterile and least attractive regions. It is one of the
most extensively distributed of all our North American birds, being found
<!--219.png--><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 172]</span>
in immense numbers over the whole length and breadth of North America.
Gambel met them in large numbers in New Mexico and California; Richardson
found them on the plains of the Saskatchewan; it is abundant in
the Arctic regions from May to October, and is equally common on the
coast of Labrador; Mr. Dall found it universal from British Columbia north.
It is also found in Florida, Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, Mexico, and Central America.
Accidental specimens have occurred in Europe.</p>

<p>This lark is a bird of easy and beautiful flight, passing and repassing
through the air with graceful evolutions, and when moving to new localities,
sweeping over the place several times before alighting. It also moves
rapidly on the ground and after the manner of the true larks, jerking the
tail like our Water-Thrushes and the European Wagtails.</p>

<p>When feeding on the open ground in the interior, their food is chiefly insects
and small seeds. On the banks of rivers and on the seashore they are
fond of running along the edge of the water, searching among the drift for
insects, small shells, and crustaceans. Near New Orleans and Charleston, in
the winter, Mr. Audubon found them feeding, in company with the Turkey
Buzzard, upon garbage.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found the Titlark abundant in every locality visited by him in
Labrador, giving him an ample opportunity to observe its habits during the
breeding-season. He found them on some of the most rocky and barren
islands along the coast. They frequented only the open, bare, and exposed
situations, such as that coast everywhere afforded, and were never found in
wooded localities. The nests of this species found by him were identical in
situation, form, and construction, placed on the sides of steep, precipitous
chasms, in small cavities in the earth, into which dry moss had been introduced
to keep the nest from the damp ground. They were composed entirely
of coarse, dry grasses loosely put together, without any lining. Their external
diameter was six inches, and the depth of the cavity two inches.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues describes the song of the male bird as very sweet and pleasant.
Mr. Audubon speaks of it as consisting of a few clear and mellow notes
when on the wing, and when standing erect on the rocks it produces a clearer
and louder song.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues speaks of their flight as undulating and unsteady, and never protracted
to any great distance. They never alight on bushes, but always on
the ground, where they run with great ease and rapidity. At low tides they
resorted to the muddy flats, where they ran about upon the eel-grass, searching
for their food in company with the small Sandpipers and in a similar
manner, finding there an abundance of food. At all times they exhibited a
heedless familiarity and an entire want of fear of man, feeding unconcernedly
around the doors of the houses, and searching for their insect food on
the roofs of the sheds and dwellings.</p>

<p>Both birds incubate and sit so closely that they may almost be trodden
upon before they are willing to leave their nest, and even then only flutter
<!--220.png--><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 173]</span>
off to a short distance, with loud cries of distress that soon bring the mate
and other pairs of the same species to join in the lamentations. They hover
over the heads of the intruders, at times approaching within a few feet, expressing
their distress by the most plaintive cries, and even when the intruders
withdraw following them to a considerable distance.</p>

<p>All the nests of this lark that I have seen are remarkable for the thickness
of their walls, and the strength, compactness, and elaborate care with which
the materials are put together, particularly for nests built on the ground.
They are well suited to protect their contents from the cold, damp ground
on which they are placed; and their upper portions are composed of stout
vegetable stems, lichens, and grasses strongly interwoven, and forming a
strong rim around the upper part of the nest.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues describes their eggs as of a dark chocolate-color, indistinctly
marked with numerous small lines and streaks of black. Audubon describes
them as having a ground-color of a deep reddish-chestnut, darkened by numerous
dots of deeper reddish-brown and lines of various sizes, especially
toward the larger end. Those in my possession, received from Labrador by
Thienemann, measure from .75 to .78 of an inch in length, and from .59
to .62 in breadth, and have a light-brown or clay-colored ground, so thickly
covered with spots as to be almost concealed. These spots are of a purplish
chocolate-brown, with occasional darker lines about the larger end. In
others the markings are bolder and larger and of brighter hues. Like the
eggs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthus arboreus</i> of Europe, it is probable that those of this
Titlark exhibit great variations, both in ground-color and in the shades of
their markings.</p>

Europe generally; common in Lapland; accidental in Greenland; <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s,
Norton Sound.</p>

<p>This species in general form resembles the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. ludovicianus</i>, the fifth
primary in both being abruptly and considerably shorter than the outer four;
the bill and legs quite similar. The average size appears much the same.
The upper parts are, however (especially the head and back), more distinctly
streaked with dusky; the edge and inside of wing greenish-yellow, not
white, and the upper plumage and outer edges of the quills decidedly olive-green.
The shafts of the middle tail-feathers above are whitish, not dark
<!--221.png--><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 174]</span>
brown; the under parts greenish-white, conspicuously streaked with dark
brown. The bill is dusky, the base and edges paler; the legs dusky flesh-color,
not dark brown.</p>

<p>The occurrence of this species in Greenland was noticed in the Review;
and since the publication of that work a specimen has been obtained at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael’s, in Alaska, by Mr. W. H. Dall, and is now in the Smithsonian
collection. The specimen in question appears to be the true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pratensis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This European species claims a place in the North American
fauna on the ground of a single specimen having been found in Greenland,
in 1845, and one at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s, Norton Sound. In the Old World it is
the counterpart of our <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludovicianus</i>, which, in all respects, it closely resembles.
It is the most common and the best known of European Titlarks. In
Great Britain, where it is found throughout the year, it appears to prefer the
uncultivated districts, inhabiting commons and waste lands, and in the more
northern parts frequenting the moors. It is also found in meadows and
marsh lands, in winter seeking more sheltered places. It is rarely seen to
alight on a branch or to sit on a rail. Its song is soft and musical, and is
usually uttered when on the wing or when vibrating over its nest. It seeks
its food altogether on the ground, running nimbly in pursuit of insects, slugs,
and worms. According to Yarrell its nest is built on the ground, generally
among the grass. It is composed externally of dried sedges, lined with finer
materials and some hair. The eggs are six in number, of a reddish-brown
color, mottled over with darker shades of the same, and measure .80 by .60
of an inch.</p>

<p>According to the observations of English naturalists, this bird resorts to
various ingenious devices to conceal its nest, or to draw aside attention from
it, such as feigning lameness when it is approached, and concealing it by
artificial covering when it has been once discovered.</p>

<p>The Meadow Pipit is common during the summer months in Denmark,
Sweden, and Norway, visiting also the Faroe Islands and Iceland. It inhabits
the whole continent of Europe as far south as Spain, Italy, and Sicily.
It has also been found in Northern Africa, and, according to Gould, in Western
Asia. Temminck also states it to be among the birds of Japan.</p>

<p>According to Degland these larks, after the breeding-season, unite in small
flocks, probably families, and frequent low and damp localities. In summer
they are more often found on high and dry mountain plains. Their flesh is
said to be delicious.</p>

neck, where there is a brownish-yellow tinge. The under parts are dull white, with a
collar of sharply defined narrow brown streaks across the forepart and along the sides of
the breast. Lores and a superciliary line whitish. Tail-feathers, except the middle ones,
dark brown; the outer one white, the second white, with the inner margin brown. The
outer primary is edged with white, and there are two dull whitish bands across the wings.
Bill and feet yellow, the former brown above. Length (female), 5.75; wing, 3.35;

<p>This little-known species has the general appearance of a Titlark, but is
readily distinguished from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthus ludovicianus</i>
by the purer white of its
under parts, the much darker centres
and much paler margins to the feathers
above, the entirely white external tail-feather,
and the yellow legs and bill, as
well as by its generic peculiarities. In
its song and general habits it approaches
nearer the European Skylark than any
bird belonging to our fauna.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This interesting species was
first described by Audubon, in the supplementary
portion of his Birds of America.
It was obtained by the party which
accompanied him to the Upper Missouri in 1843. It was first met with on
the 19th of June near Fort Union, in Dacotah Territory. It has since been
found on the fork of the Saskatchewan, but little additional information
respecting its habits has been obtained since its first discovery.</p>

<p>It seems to more nearly approach, in its habits, the European Skylark
than any other of our North American birds. Mr. Edward Harris was completely
misled, at first, by the sound of their song, so that on several occasions
he sought for them on the ground. Their voices appeared to come to
<!--223.png--><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 176]</span>
him from the earth’s surface. After having travelled in quest of them, to
no purpose, to many distant parts of the prairies, he at last discovered that
these sounds proceeded from several
of these birds soaring at so great an
elevation as to make them difficult to
discover by the eye, even in the transparent
atmosphere of that country.</p>

<p>They are described as running gracefully
on the ground, at times squatting
to observe the movements of the
intruders, and again elevating their
bodies as if to meet their approach.
Rising from the ground, they fly in an undulating manner, so that it is
extremely difficult to shoot them on the wing. They continue thus to fly
in increasing circles until about a hundred yards high, when they begin to
sing. After a while, suddenly closing their wings, they drop to the ground.
They could be easily approached in a light wagon, and in this manner
several specimens were obtained.</p>

<p>Captain Blakiston (Ibis, <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> 61) found this Skylark common on the prairies
of the Saskatchewan during the breeding-season. He first met with it on
the 6th of May, near Fort Carlton. When disturbed from the grass, its
usual haunt, it utters a single chirp, and immediately mounts in the air by
a circuitous course, with a very undulating flight, to a great height, where
with outstretched wings it soars in a peculiar manner, and utters a very
striking song. This is described as consisting of a quick succession of
notes, in a descending scale, each note being lower than the preceding. The
bird then descends to the ground with great rapidity, almost like a stone,
and somewhat in the manner of a hawk swooping on its prey. It was
difficult of approach, and not easily killed. He also observed these birds in
Northern Minnesota, May 4, 1859.</p>

<p>A nest of this bird was built on the ground and placed in a hollow. It
was made of fine grasses interwoven into a circular form, but without any
lining. The eggs were four or five in number, an oblong oval in shape, much
pointed at one end, and measuring .87 of an inch in length by .63 in breadth.
Their ground-color was a dull white, so minutely dotted with a grayish-purple
as to give the whole egg a homogeneous appearance, as of that
uniform color.</p>

<p>The young larks, soon after being hatched, followed their parents on the
ground, and were fed with seeds of the smaller plants and with insects.
They had already begun to associate in small flocks of from eight to a dozen
before the party left, and on the 16th of August had commenced their
southern migrations.</p>

<h2><span class="sc">Family</span> <b class="birdname">SYLVICOLIDÆ</b>.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Warblers.</span></h2>

<p class="p2">The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvicolidæ</i> are essentially characterized among the Oscines with nine
primaries, by their small size, the usually slender and conical insectivorous
bill, shorter than the head, without angle in the gape near the base; the toes
deeply cleft so as to leave the inner one free almost to its very base (except
in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mniotiltæ</i>), etc. The shallow notch at the end of the tongue, instead of
a deeply fissured tip, distinguishes the family from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cærebidæ</i>, to some of
which there is otherwise so great a resemblance. The absence of abrupt
hook and notch in both mandibles separates it from such of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireonidæ</i>
as have nine primaries.</p>

<p>The American <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Motacillidæ</i> are distinguished from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvicolidæ</i> by
the emargination of the outer and the great elongation of the inner secondaries,
as well as by other features referred to under that family.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthus</i>, in particular, differs in the lengthened and slightly curved hind
claw. There is little difficulty in distinguishing the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvicolidæ</i>, however,
from any families excepting the slender-billed forms of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tanagridæ</i>, as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chlorospingus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemosia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chlorochrysa</i>, etc., and the conirostral <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cœrebidæ</i>.
In fact, some ornithologists are inclined to include all three of the families
thus mentioned in one, from the difficulty of marking their boundaries
respectively.</p>

<p>In fact, we are of the opinion that no violence would be done by adopting
this view, and would even include with the above-mentioned families
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fringillidæ</i> also. The order of their relation to one another would be
thus: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fringillidæ, Tanagridæ, Sylvicolidæ, Cœrebidæ</i>; there being scarcely
any break in the transition between the two extremes, unless there are
many genera referred to the wrong family, as seems very likely to be the case
with many included in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tanagridæ</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fringilline</i> forms of the latter
family are such genera as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Buarremon</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arremon</i>, they being so closely
related to some <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fringilline</i> genera by so many features&mdash;as rounded concave
wing, lax plumage, and spizine coloration&mdash;as to be scarcely separable.
Either these two families are connected so perfectly by intermediate forms
as to be inseparable, or the term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tanagridæ</i> covers too great a diversity of
forms. With the same regularity that we proceed from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fringillidæ</i> to
the typical forms of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tanagridæ</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyranga</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tanagra</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calliste</i>, etc.), we
pass down the scale from these to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvicolidæ</i>; while between many
genera of the latter family, and others referred to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cærebidæ</i>, no difference
in external anatomy can be discovered, much less expressed in a
description.</p>

<p>In the following synopsis we attempt to define the higher groups of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvicolidæ</i>, although in the large number of species and their close relationships
it is very difficult to express clearly their distinctive features.</p>

General form sylvicoline; bill rather long, compressed, shorter than the

the tail, which is slightly rounded; first quill shorter than second and third. Tarsi rather
short; toes long, middle one equal to the tarsus; hind toe nearly as long, the claw considerably

white, blotched with red.</p>

<p>This genus differs from other Sylvicolines in the elongation of the toes,
especially the hinder one, by means of which the species is enabled to move
up and down the trunks of trees, like the true Creepers. But one species is
recognized as North American, although Nuttall describes a second.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Black and White Creeper, nowhere an abundant species, is
met with in various sections of the country. It occurs in all parts of New
England and New York, and has been found in the interior as far north as
Fort Simpson. It has been met with on the Pacific coast only at Mazatlan,
is common in the Bahamas and most of the West India Islands, generally
as a migrant. It has also been found in Texas, in the Indian Territory,
and in Mexico, and throughout Central America. In the last-named
region Mr. Salvin states it to be pretty equally and generally spread over
the whole country. It is there migratory, leaving in spring. It was also
detected in Colombia, South America, by Mr.
C. W. Wyatt. Mr. Newton also met with it
as a winter visitant in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix, leaving that
island at the end of March. He regards this
species as almost a thorough Creeper in habits.
In Jamaica a few are resident throughout the
year, according to the observations of Mr.
March, and though its nests have never been
found there, a son of Mr. March saw a pair
carrying materials with which to construct
one.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues states that this Warbler is a very
common summer resident near Washington,
but is more abundant there in the spring and in the fall, the greater number
going farther north to breed. They arrive in Washington during the first
week in April, and are exceedingly numerous until May. He adds that they
are generally found in high open woods, and that they “breed in holes in
trees.” This is probably an error, or, if ever known to occur, an entirely
exceptional case.</p>

<p>Our bird is also a common summer visitant at Calais, arriving there about
the 1st of May, and by the 10th becoming rather abundant. Mr. Boardman
has frequently found their nests there, and always on the ground, in rocky
places and usually under small trees.</p>

<p>It does not appear to have been met with on the Pacific coast north of
Mazatlan, nor in any portion of Western North America, beyond the valleys
of the Mississippi and the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>In its habits this bird seems to be more of a Creeper than a Warbler.
It is an expert and nimble climber, and rarely, if ever, perches on the branch
of a tree or shrub. In the manner of the smaller Woodpeckers, the Creepers,
Nuthatches, and Titmice, it moves rapidly around the trunks and larger
limbs of the trees of the forest in search of small insects and their larvæ.
<!--229.png--><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 182]</span>
It is graceful and rapid in movement, and is often so intent upon its hunt
as to be unmindful of the near presence of man.</p>

<p>It is found chiefly in thickets, but this is probably owing to the fact that there
its food is principally to be obtained. It is occasionally seen in more open
country, and has been known to breed in the immediate vicinity of a dwelling.</p>

<p>Wilson regarded this bird as a true Creeper, and objected to its being
classed as a Warbler. He even denied to it the possession of any song. In
this he was quite mistaken. Though never loud, prolonged, or powerful, the
song of this Warbler is very sweet and pleasing. It begins to sing from its
first appearance in May, and continues to repeat its brief refrain at intervals
almost until its departure in August and September. Nuttall speaks of it
as being at first a monotonous ditty, and as uttered in a strong but shrill and
filing tone. These notes, he adds, as the season advances, become more mellow
and warbling, and, though feeble, are pleasing, and are similar to those
of the Redstart. But this statement does not do full justice to the varied
and agreeable notes with which, in early spring, these birds accompany their
lively hunt for food among the tops of the forest trees. They are diversified
and sweet, and seem suggestive of a genial and happy nature.</p>

<p>These birds make their appearance in New England early in May, and
remain there, among the thick woods, until the middle of October, and in the
Southern States until the verge of winter.</p>

<p>Their movements in search of food are like those of the Titmice, keeping
the feet together and moving in a succession of short rapid hops up the
trunks of trees and along the limbs, passing again to the bottom by longer
flights than in the ascent. They make but short flights from tree to tree,
but are apparently not incapable of more prolonged ones.</p>

<p>So far as I know, these birds always build their nests on the ground. Mr.
Nuttall found one in Roxbury containing young about a week old. The nest
was on the ground, on the surface of a shelving rock, made of coarse strips
of the inner bark of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abies canadensis</i> externally, and internally of soft
decayed leaves and dry grasses, and lined with a thin layer of black hair.
The parents fed their young in his presence with affectionate attention, and
manifested no uneasiness, creeping, head downward, about the trunks of the
neighboring trees, carrying large smooth caterpillars to their young. The
nests of this bird are strongly and compactly built, externally of coarse strips
of various kinds of bark, and lined within with hair and fine stems of grasses.
In several instances I have known them to be roofed over at the top, in the
manner of the Golden-crowned Thrush. They measure about three inches
in their external diameter, and are equally deep.</p>

<p>The nests appear to be a favorite receptacle for the parasitic eggs of the
Cow-Bunting. Mr. Robert Ridgway obtained a nest at <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr> Carmel, <abbr title="Illinois">Ill.</abbr>,
in which were four eggs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molothrus</i> and only two of the parent birds;
and Mr. T. M. Trippe, of Orange, <abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr>, also found a nest of this Creeper
in which were but three of its own and five of the parasite.</p>

<p><!--230.png--><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span>
The eggs vary in shape from a rounded to an oblong oval, and in size from
.69 to .75 of an inch in length, and from .51 to .53 of an inch in breadth.
Their ground-color is a creamy-white, to which the deep red markings impart
an apparently pinkish tinge. They are marked more or less profusely with
bright red dots, points, and blotches. These vary in number and in distribution.
In some they are very fine, and are chiefly confined to the larger end.
In others they are larger, more diffused, and occasionally there are intermingled
marks and blotches of slate-color. The effect of these variations
is, at times, to give the appearance of greater differences to these eggs than
really exists, the ground-color and the shade of the red markings really presenting
but little modifications.</p>

<p>The color of the young nestlings is closely assimilated to that of the
objects that usually surround the nest, and helps to conceal them. Mr.
Burroughs once came accidentally upon a nest with young of this species.
He says: “A Black and White Creeping Warbler suddenly became much
alarmed as I approached a crumbling old stump in a dense part of the forest.
He alighted upon it, chirped sharply, ran up and down its sides, and finally
left it with much reluctance. The nest, which contained three young birds
nearly fledged, was placed upon the ground at the foot of the stump, and in
such a position that the color of the young harmonized perfectly with the
bits of bark, sticks, etc., lying about. My eye rested upon them for the
second time before I made them out. They hugged the nest very closely,
but as I put down my hand they all scampered off with loud cries for help,
which caused the parent birds to place themselves almost within my reach.”</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> In regard to the habits of this beautiful and interesting Warbler
we receive but little light from the observations
of older ornithological writers.
Its geographical distribution is somewhat
erratic and irregular. It does not
appear to be distributed over a very
wide range. It occurs as a migrant in
the West Indies and in Central America.
In the United States it is found
in the Southern region, but farther west
the range widens, and in the Mississippi
Valley it is found as far north as Kansas,
Southern and Central Illinois, and Missouri. Accidental specimens have been
obtained as far to the northeast as Calais, though unknown to all the Eastern
States as far south as Southern Virginia. It was met with by none of the government
parties except by Dr. Woodhouse, who found it abundant in Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon observed them, near Louisville, Kentucky, frequenting creeks
and lagoons overshadowed by large trees. These were their favorite places
<!--232.png--><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span>
of resort. They also preferred the borders of sheets of water to the interior
of the forest. They return in spring to the Southern States early in March,
but to Kentucky not before the last of April. They leave in October, and
raise but a single brood in a season. Audubon describes their nest, but it
differs so essentially from their known mode of breeding, that he was
evidently in error in regard to his supposed identification of the nest of
this species.</p>

<p>Dr. Bachman, who often met them on the borders of small streams near
Charleston, was confident that they breed in that State, and noticed a pair
with four young birds as early as June 1, in 1836.</p>

<p>Recently more light has been thrown upon their habits by Mr. B. F.
Goss, who, in May, 1863, found them breeding near Neosho Falls, in Kansas.
The nest was built within a Woodpecker’s hole in the stump of a tree,
not more than three feet high. The nest was not rounded in shape, but
made to conform to the irregular cavity in which it was built. It was
of oblong shape, and its cavity was deepest, not in the centre, but at one
end, upon a closely impacted base made up of fragments of dried leaves,
broken bits of grasses, stems, mosses, and lichens, decayed wood, and other
material, the upper portion consisting of an interweaving of fine roots of
wooded plants, varying in size, but all strong, wiry, and slender. It was
lined with hair.</p>

<p>Other nests since discovered are of more uniform forms, circular in shape,
and of coarser materials, and all are built with unusual strength and care for
a nest occupying a sheltered cavity.</p>

<p>In one instance their nest was built in a brace-hole within a mill, where
the birds could be closely watched as they carried in the materials, and the
parent was afterward taken by hand by Mr. Goss from its nest. It was
quite tame, and approached within two yards of him.</p>

<p>Since then Mr. Ridgway has obtained a nest at <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr> Carmel, <abbr title="Illinois">Ill.</abbr> It was
built in a hollow snag, about five feet from the ground, in the river bottom.
So far from being noisy and vociferous, as its name would seem to
imply, Mr. Ridgway describes it as one of the shyest and most silent of all
the Warblers.</p>

<p>The eggs of this Warbler have an average breadth of .55 of an inch and a
length varying from .65 to .70 of an inch. They are of a rounded-oval form,
one end being but slightly less rounded than the other. Their ground-color
is a yellowish or creamy white, more or less profusely marked over their
entire surface with lilac, purple, and a dark purplish-brown.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway states that it is always an abundant summer bird in the
Wabash bottoms, where it inhabits principally bushy swamps and the willows
around the borders of stagnant lagoons or “ponds” near the river, and
in such localities, in company with the White-bellied Swallow (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hirundo
bicolor</i>), takes possession of the holes of the Downy Woodpecker (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus
pubescens</i>) and Chickadee (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parus carolinensis</i>), in which to build its nest.</p>

<p><!--233.png--><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span>
Mr. Ridgway adds that in its movements this Warbler is slow and deliberate,
like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Helmitherus vermivorus</i>, strikingly different in this respect
from the sprightly, active <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroecæ</i>. Its common note is a sharp <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">piph</i>, remarkably
like the winter note of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zonotrichia albicollis</i>.</p>

<p>It has been taken as far north as Rock Island, <abbr title="Illinois">Ill.</abbr>, and Dr. Coues mentions
the occurrence of one individual near Washington, D. C., seen in a
swampy brier-patch, May 2, 1861. This was perhaps only an accidental
visitor. If regularly found there, it is probably exceedingly rare. It has not
been met with between Washington and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephens, New Brunswick, where
its occurrence was unquestionably purely accidental.</p>

<p>The birds of this division are very

other American Warblers. There are
but two species referable to the genus, of which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. swainsoni</i> differs
from the type in having a considerably
longer and more compressed bill, the
ridge of which is compressed, elevated,
and appears to extend backwards on
the forehead, as well as to be in a
straight line with the upper part of
the head. The wings are longer; the
tail forked; not rounded; the feathers
narrower and more pointed; the tarsi
shorter than in the type. It appears

Bill nearly as long as the head; upper parts generally rather clear olive-green.
Head with four black stripes and three brownish-yellow ones, namely, a black one
on each side of the crown and one from behind the eye (extending, in fact, a little anterior
to it), a broader median yellow one on the crown, and a superciliary from the bill. Under
parts pale brownish-yellow; tinged with buff across the breast and with olivaceous on the
sides. Tail unspotted. Female nearly similar. Length, 5.50; wing, 3.00; tail, 2.35.</p>

<p class="small">In autumnal specimens the light stripes on the head are deeper buff than in spring.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern Province of United States (rather Southern); Southeastern Mexico; Guatemala;
Cuba; Costa Rica; Veragua; Orizaba (winter, <span class="sc">Sumichrast</span>); Yucatan (<span class="sc">Lawrence</span>).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Much remains to be ascertained in regard to the history, habits, and
distribution of this interesting species. So far as is now known it is hardly
anywhere very common during the breeding-season. Yet its abundance and
wide distribution as a migrant during the winter months in various extended
localities appear to warrant the belief that it must be correspondingly abundant
in summer in localities that have escaped our attention. It has been occasionally
met with in the Central and Southern States, as far west as Eastern
Mexico, and as far to the north as Southeastern New York. Specimens have
been procured from Cuba, Mexico, Central America, and the northern portions
of South America. It is a regular winter visitant of Jamaica, whither it goes
in the autumn in considerable numbers, and is very widely diffused.</p>

<p>It reaches Pennsylvania about the middle of May, and leaves in September.
Wilson noticed a pair feeding their young about the 25th of June.
<!--235.png--><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 188]</span>
He supposed this bird to have a more northern distribution than belongs to
it. In the interior they are met with, according to Audubon, as far north as
the southern shores of Lake Erie, where he found them in the autumn. Mr.
Audubon found them more numerous in New Jersey than anywhere else. In
Ohio and Kentucky they are comparatively rare. Mr. Ridgway informs me
that this is a rather common species in Southern Illinois in the thickest
damp woods in the bottom-lands along the Wabash River.</p>

<p>According to Wilson, these birds are among the nimblest of its family, and
are remarkably fond of spiders, darting about wherever there is a probability
of finding these insects. Where branches are broken and the leaves withered,
it searches among them in preference, making a great rustling as it hunts for
its prey. Their stomachs are generally found full of spiders and caterpillars.</p>

<p>These birds are arboreal in their preferences, residing in the interior of
woods, and are seldom seen in the open fields. They resort to the ground
and turn over the dry leaves in quest of insects. They are very unsuspicious
and easy of approach.</p>

<p>Nuttall describes their notes and their habits as resembling the common
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parus atricapillus</i>, and remarks that they are constantly uttering a complaining
call, sounding like <i class="birdcall">tshe-dē-dē</i>.</p>

<p>Until quite recently, nothing has been positively known in regard to its
nesting. Audubon has described its nest as made of dry mosses and the
fallen bloom of the hickory and the chestnut, and as built in bushes several
feet from the ground. He describes the eggs as cream-colored, marked about
the larger end with reddish-brown. These descriptions have not been confirmed,
and all our information has led us to look for its nest on the ground.</p>

<p>Mr. Trippe states that it is found, but is not at all common, near Orange,
<abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr>, where it arrives about the middle of May. It has, at that time, a
rapid, chattering note, and it always, he says, keeps near the ground, and,
besides its chattering song, has in June a series of odd notes, much like
those of the White-breasted Nuthatch, but more varied and musical, yet
hardly entitled to be called a song.</p>

<p>Mr. T. H. Jackson of Westchester, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>, in the American Naturalist for
December, 1869, mentions finding the nest and eggs of this bird. We give
his account in his own words: “On the 6th of June, 1869, I found a nest
of this species containing five eggs. It was placed in a hollow on the ground,
much like the nests of the Oven-Bird (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Seiurus aurocapillus</i>), and was hidden
from sight by the dry leaves that lay thickly around. The nest was composed
externally of dead leaves, mostly those of the beech, while the interior
was prettily lined with the fine, thread-like stalks of the hair-moss,
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polytrichium</i>). Altogether it was a very neat structure, and looked to me as
though the owner was habitually a ground nester. The eggs most nearly
resemble those of the White-bellied Nuthatch (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitta carolinensis</i>), though the
markings are fewer and less distinct. So close did the female sit that I
captured her without difficulty by placing my hat over the nest.”</p>

<p><!--236.png--><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 189]</span>
The same observing ornithologist informs me that this Warbler arrives in
Pennsylvania early in May, and makes the most solitary part of the woods
its home, outside of which it is rarely seen. True to its name, it is ever
busy hunting out and devouring the worms that lurk among the forest foliage,
pursuing its avocation in silence, with the exception of a faint note
uttered occasionally. This species is not as shy as many of our Warblers that
frequent the woods. Towards the latter part of May they commence constructing
their nests. Mr. Jackson adds that the nest above referred to was
found on a thickly wooded hillside, a few yards above a running stream. So
neatly was it embedded in the ground and covered with dry leaves, that
discovery would have been impossible had not the female betrayed its
position. Both birds exhibited the greatest alarm at his presence, but on
his retiring to a short distance the female returned to the nest, where she
was easily captured. The base and periphery of the nest were composed
of dry beech-leaves, while the inner lining was made of fine hair-mosses
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polytrichium</i>).</p>

<p>In the latter part of June, 1871, Mr. Jackson found another nest of this
species, containing five young birds about half grown. He was seated on
a log, resting after a hard tramp, when a Worm-eating Warbler alighted near
him, having a large green worm in its beak. After at first manifesting much
uneasiness, and scolding as well as she could, she suddenly became silent and
flew to the ground. On his going to the spot both parents flew from the
nest. It was in all respects, in regard to materials, manner of construction,
and situation, the exact counterpart of the other. Both were placed on steep,
wooded hillsides, facing the east.</p>

<p>Two of the eggs of this Warbler thus identified by Mr. Jackson, and kindly
loaned to me by him, are of a somewhat rounded-oval shape, less obtuse at
one end. They have a clear, crystal-white ground, and are spotted with
minute dottings of a bright red-brown. These are much more numerous in
one than in the other, and in both are confluent at the larger end, where
they are beautifully intermingled with cloudings of lilac-brown. These eggs
measure, the one .78 by .60 of an inch; the other, .70 by .56 of an inch.</p>

<p>Another nest of this species, found by Mr. Joseph H. Batty of New York,
on the side of a hill near Montclair, <abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr>, was also built on the ground, in
a part of the woods where there was no underbrush, and was placed in a
slight hollow, with dry oak-leaves collected around it, and partly covering it.
The nest was made of dry leaves, and lined with grasses and fine roots. It
contained four eggs, alike in their marking, and corresponding exactly with
those obtained by Mr. Jackson. Mr. Batty nearly stepped on the bird without
her leaving the nest.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found the Worm-eating Warbler a rather uncommon summer
resident near Washington, breeding there but sparingly. It arrives there
during the first week in May, and remains until the third week in September.
He describes it as slow and sedate in its movements.</p>

on the wings, and still more on the crown and nape; a superciliary stripe and the
under parts of the body are white, tinged with yellow, but palest on the tail-coverts; the

<p>A young bird (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 32,241 Liberty <abbr title="County">Co.</abbr>, Georgia) is very similar to the adult
described, but differs in the following respects: the lower parts have a decided
soiled, sulphur-yellow tinge, while the brown of the upper parts is
much more reddish, there being no difference in tint between the crown
and back; also the superciliary stripe is more sharply defined.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species is comparatively rare, and, so far as is known, has a
very restricted distribution. It was first discovered by <abbr title="Review">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Bachman,
in the vicinity of Charleston, <abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>, near the banks of the Edisto River.
This was in the spring of 1832. He was first attracted by the novelty of its
notes, which were four or five in number and repeated at intervals of a few
minutes. These notes were loud and clear, and more like a whistle than a
song. They resembled the sounds of some extraordinary ventriloquist,&mdash;so
much so that he at first supposed the bird to be much farther off than it
really was. He was so fortunate as to secure it. The shape of the bill he
at once noticed as being different from that of any other American bird then
known to him. In the course of that season he obtained two other specimens.
Toward the close of the same season he saw an old female, accompanied by
its four young. One of the latter, which he procured, did not differ materially
from the old birds.</p>

<p>He met with them only in swampy and muddy places, and when opened,
he always found their stomachs filled with fragments of coleopterous insects,
as well as small green worms, such as are common on water-plants. The
habits of this species most resemble those of the Prothonotary Warbler,
as the latter skips among the low bushes growing about ponds or in marshy
places. It is seldom seen on high trees. Nothing is known as to their
nesting or eggs.</p>

extent of territory. Wilson met with it in Pennsylvania during the last of
April and the first of May, believing it to be only a migrant species on its
way to more northern regions. Nuttall was sceptical of these conclusions,
as he never met with the species in the New England States. Audubon
observed these birds in their migrations through Louisiana, which State they
entered from Texas in the month of April. He procured several specimens
in Louisiana and Kentucky, and one in New Jersey. He knew nothing as
to its breeding, and seems to have accepted Wilson’s inferences in regard to
its northern migrations. He never met with this bird in the fall, when, if a
Northern species, it should be returning south, and thence inferred that it
migrated by night.</p>

<p>Professor Baird has obtained this bird near Carlisle, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>, in July,
rendering probable its breeding in that vicinity. W. S. Wood met with
it near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, May 13, 1857, and two days previously in the same
year Mr. Kennicott procured an individual in Southern Illinois. Occasionally
specimens have been obtained in Massachusetts, and of late these
occurrences have become more frequent or more observed. It was first
noticed near Boston by J. Eliot Cabot, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, who shot one in May, 1838,
near Fresh Pond. This was, he thinks, on the 20th of that month. Since
then Mr. J. A. Allen has known of several specimens taken within the
State. Mr. Jillson has observed it spending the summer in Bolton, and
evidently breeding, as has also Mr. Allen at Springfield, and Mr. Bennett at
Holyoke. In the summer of 1870, Mr. Maynard obtained its nest and eggs
in Newton.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Gerhardt found it breeding among the high grounds of Northern
Georgia. It has also been taken at Racine, <abbr title="Wisconsin">Wis.</abbr>, by Dr. Hoy, and in
Ohio. These data seem to show that it is sparingly found from Georgia to
Massachusetts, and from New Jersey to Missouri and Wisconsin. Its western
limits may be more extended. It was not met with by any of the exploring
parties beyond <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, but its retiring habits and its sparse distribution

<p>Dr. Samuel Cabot was the first naturalist to meet with the nest and eggs
of this bird. This was in May, 1837, in Greenbrier County, <abbr title="Virginia">Va.</abbr> The nest
was constructed in the midst of a low bush on high ground, and contained
four eggs.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Alexander Gerhardt found the nest and eggs of this Warbler
in the spring of 1859, in Whitfield County, <abbr title="Georgia">Ga.</abbr> It contained four eggs, and
was built on the ground. It was very large for the bird, being five inches in
height and four in diameter. The cavity was also quite large and deep for
so small a bird, exceeding three inches both in depth and in diameter. The
outer and under portions of this nest were almost entirely composed of the
dry leaves of several kinds of deciduous trees. These were interwoven with
and strongly bound together by black vegetable roots, dry sedges, and fine
strips of pliant bark, and the whole lined with a close network of fine
<!--241.png--><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 194]</span>
leaves, dry grasses, and fibrous roots. Dr. Gerhardt informed me that these
birds usually build on or near the ground, under tussocks of grass, in clumps
of bushes, or pine-brush, and that they lay from four to five eggs, from the
6th to the 15th of May.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are of a beautiful, clear crystal-white, with a few
bright reddish-brown spots around the larger end. Eggs from Racine, <abbr title="Wisconsin">Wis.</abbr>,
and from Northern Georgia, differ greatly in their relative size. The former
measure .70 of an inch in length and .53 in breadth; the latter, .63
by .49.</p>

<p>A single specimen of this species was obtained by Mr. Salvin, at Choctum,
in Guatemala.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Bachman’s Warbler is a comparatively new and but little known
species of this interesting group. It was first discovered, July, 1833, by Rev.
Dr. John Bachman, a few miles from Charleston, <abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>, and in the same vicinity
he afterwards discovered a few others of both sexes. He described it
as a lively, active bird, gliding among the branches of the thick bushes, occasionally
mounting on the wing and seizing insects in the air, in the manner
of a Flycatcher. The individual first obtained was an old female which
had, to all appearances, just reared a brood of young. With this partial exception,
nothing is known in relation to its habits. As all the species of this
genus, without any at present known exception, construct their nests upon
the ground, it is a natural inference that it probably nests in a similar situation.</p>

<p>The Smithsonian Institution possesses but a single specimen of this bird,
obtained near Charleston, <abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr> It was not observed by any naturalist of
the several governmental exploring expeditions, and, so far as we are at
present informed, its only known places of abode are South Carolina and
Cuba, where it is extremely rare. Its nest and eggs still remain unknown.

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern United States and Mexico to Guatemala (Cordova; Coban). Not
noted from West Indies.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Blue-winged Yellow Warbler is not known so far to the
north as New England, and is rare even in Eastern and Southern New York.
It seems to be distributed through the United States from Pennsylvania to
Florida, and from the Mississippi Valley eastward. It has also been taken
in Central America. Mr. Trippe states that it breeds in the vicinity of
Orange, <abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr> Mr. Audubon found it abundant in the barrens of Kentucky,
and as far north on the Mississippi as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Genevieve.</p>

<p>In regard to the song of this bird, Mr. Trippe states that its notes are very
forcible and characteristic. Once heard, they will always be remembered.
He describes them as a rapid chirrup resembling <i class="birdcall">chūūchich, k´-a-re-r´r´r´r´r</i>,
uttered very quickly. According to Mr. Ridgway, they are wonderfully
similar to the rude lisping chirrup of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coturniculus passerinus</i>.</p>

<p>Wilson says that these Warblers come from the South early in May, frequenting
thickets and shrubberies in search of insects, which they seek in
the branches. They are also fond of visiting gardens and orchards, gleaning
for insects among the low bushes. They generally build their nests on the
edge of sequestered woods. These Mr. Wilson states to have been, in every
instance observed by him, fixed on the ground, in a thick tussock of long
grass, and built in the form of an inverted cone, the sides being formed
of the dry bark of strong fibrous weeds lined with fine dry grasses. These
materials, he remarks, are not arranged in the usual circular manner, but
shelve downward from the top, the mouth being wide and the bottom narrow.
He describes the eggs as five in number, pure white, with a few faint dots
of reddish near the larger end. The young appear the first week in June.
The nests were always in an open but retired part of the woods, and were
all as thus described.</p>

<p><!--245.png--><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 196]</span>
According to Mr. Audubon its song consists of a few weak notes that are
by no means interesting. His description of its nest agrees with that of
Wilson. He states that it usually has two broods in the season, one in May,
the other in July. The young disperse as soon as they are able to provide for
themselves.</p>

<p>He describes them as of solitary habits, and adds that they leave Louisiana
for the South early in October. Its flight is short, undetermined, and
performed in zigzag lines. It will ascend twenty or thirty yards in the
air as if about to go to a greater distance, when, suddenly turning round, it
will descend to the place from which it set out. It rarely pursues insects
on the wing, feeding chiefly on the smaller kind of spiders, and seizing other
insects as they come within its reach.</p>

<p>The above accounts of its breeding, and especially of its nest, do not correspond
with the observations of Mr. Ridgway, near <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr> Carmel, <abbr title="Illinois">Ill.</abbr>, where
the bird is abundant. A nest collected by him is a very loose open structure,
composed chiefly of broad, thin, and flexible strips of the inner bark
of deciduous trees, chiefly the bass-wood. It contained five eggs, and was
obtained May 8. It was first discovered by noticing the bird with materials
in her bill. The situation of this nest “was in no wise,” says Mr. Ridgway,
“as described by Wilson, not having any covered entrance.” The nest
was very bulky, and so loosely made that only the inner portion could be
secured. “I have found other nests,” adds Mr. Ridgway, “all corresponding
with this one. There can be no doubt as to its identity, as the birds
were seen building the nest, and were closely watched in their movements.
Both male and female were seen several times.” (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 10,140, <abbr title="Smithsonian Collection">Smith. Coll.</abbr>)</p>

<p>The eggs of this species measure .70 of an inch in length by .53 in breadth.
Their aground-color is white, sprinkled with a few reddish-brown spots.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact, that, in this species, we find in the yellow a tendency
to become more and more restricted as we pass westward. In adult
spring males from the Atlantic States this color invades the cheeks, and
even stains the lores and eyelids. In two adult spring males from Chicago
it is confined within the maxillæ, the cheeks being clear ash, and the loral
streak and orbital ring pure white; while in an adult male (autumnal, however)
from the East Humboldt Mountains (Nevada, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 53,354, U. S. <abbr title="Geological Exploration, 40th parallel">Geol.
Expl., 40th par.</abbr>) the yellow is restricted to a medial strip, even the sides
of the throat being ashy; the ash invades the back too, almost to the rump,
while in Eastern specimens it extends no farther back than the nape. A
male (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 10,656, J. Xantus) from Fort Tejon, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, is much like the Nevada
specimen, though the peculiar features of the remote Western form are
less exaggerated; it is about intermediate between the other specimen and
the specimens from Chicago. As there is not, unfortunately, a sufficiently
large series of these birds before us, we cannot say to what extent these
variations with longitude are constant.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Nashville Warbler appears to be a species of somewhat
irregular occurrence; at one time it will be rather abundant, though never
very numerous, and at another time comparatively rare. For a long while our
older naturalists regarded it as a very rare species, and knew nothing as to
its habits or distribution. Wilson, who first met with it in 1811, never found
more than three specimens, which he procured near Nashville, Tenn. Audubon
only met with three or four, and these he obtained in Louisiana and
Kentucky. These and a few others in Titian Peale’s collection, supposed to
have been obtained in Pennsylvania, were all he ever saw. Mr. Nuttall at
first regarded it as very rare, and as a Southern species. In that writer’s later
edition he speaks of it as a bird having a Northern distribution as far as
Labrador. Dr. Richardson records the occurrence of a single straggler in the
fur country. So far as known, it occurs as a migrant in all the States
east of the Missouri, and is a summer resident north of the 40th parallel.
It probably breeds in the high ground of Pennsylvania, though this fact is
inferred rather than known. It breeds in Connecticut and Massachusetts,
and in Maine in the vicinity of Calais, being more abundant there than anywhere
else, as far as has been ascertained.</p>

<p>Two individuals of this species have been taken in Greenland: one at
Godthaab, in 1835; and the other at Fiskenæsset, August 31, 1840.</p>

<p><!--247.png--><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 198]</span>
In Massachusetts it has so far been found in only a few restricted localities,
Andover, Lynn, and Hudson, though it undoubtedly occurs elsewhere.
About the time Wilson obtained his first specimen, a living bird of this
species flew into the parlor of the late Colonel Thomas H. Perkins of Brookline,
and is now in the collection of his grandson, Dr. Cabot. The latter
gentleman states that when he first began making collections this Warbler
was a very rare visitant to his neighborhood, but has of late become
much more common, though varying greatly in this respect in different
seasons. Specimens have been obtained in Western Iowa by Mr. H. W.
Parker, of Grinnell.</p>

<p>A few instances of its occurrence west of the Mississippi Valley are known.
One of these was by Xantus near Fort Tejon; another near Lake Tahoe, in the
Sierra Nevada, by Mr. Gruber; and in the East Humboldt Mountains, Nevada,
by Mr. Ridgway. Specimens of this Warbler were obtained in the winter by
M. Boucard at Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1854, Mr. Charles S. Paine found it breeding in Randolph,
<abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, but was unable to discover the nest. “They spend the summer,”
he wrote, “among low bushes, and probably build their nests among
the thickets. I have watched their movements on several occasions. Once
I detected an old bird with food in her bill about to feed her young. I could
hear the young birds, yet was unable to find the nest.” Two years later,
Mr. George O. Welch, of Lynn, found the nest of this Warbler on the
ground in a small thicket. It contained young partially fledged, and one
egg unhatched. The nest was built in a slight depression, in a dry place,
among fallen leaves and in the shelter of a thicket of young oak-trees.
This egg in shape was of a rounded oval, and measured .59 by .50 of an inch;
one end was slightly more pointed than the other. The ground-color was
white, slightly tinged with pink, and marked over the entire surface with
purplish-brown dots. Around the larger end these spots form a beautiful
wreath of confluent markings. Since then other nests have been found in
the same locality, all on the ground and built in like situations. They have
a diameter of four and a height of two inches. The cavity has a diameter
of two and a depth of one and a quarter inches. The outer portions are
built of dry mosses, intermingled with strips of the bark of the wild grape
and the red cedar and a few herbaceous twigs, and lined with a thick layer
of dried carices, small leaves of the white pine, and fine grasses. The whole
structure is loosely put together. The nests are generally concealed by overarching
leaves, which, however, form no part of the nest itself.</p>

<p>The late Elijah P. Barrow, of Andover, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, a young naturalist of much
promise, found several nests of this rare Warbler, all of which were concealed
by grass. The eggs he found varied in length from .59 to .61 of an
inch, and in breadth from .50 to .51 of an inch. Both parents, as observed
by him, were entirely silent.</p>

<p>The Nashville Warbler has been said to be a comparatively silent and
<!--248.png--><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 199]</span>
songless bird, rarely giving forth any sounds, and these are compared by Dr.
Richardson to the creaking noise made by the whetting of a saw. Wilson
compares these sounds to the cracking of dry twigs or the striking together
of small pebbles. Mr. J. A. Allen speaks of its song as being similar to that
of the Chestnut-sided Warbler, which latter bird, as is well known, has notes
so closely resembling those of the Summer Yellow-Bird that it is difficult to
distinguish one from the other by their notes. Mr. T. M. Trippe states, also,
that this Warbler has a very fine song, resembling that of the Summer Yellow-Bird
more nearly than any other.</p>

<p>These Warblers arrive in Massachusetts about the first of May, and remain
about three weeks, when the larger portion move farther north.</p>

<p>More recently Mr. Paine writes me that the Nashville Warbler has of
late years become a common bird in certain localities in Central Vermont.
They come and keep company with the Canada Warbler, but are more restless
than that species at the time of their first appearance. They always
in the breeding-season take up their abode in thickets, where there are also
tall trees. Mr. Paine adds that their song consists of repetitions of single
notes, the last terminating somewhat abruptly. Their song ceases by the
10th of June. After their young are ready to fly, they disperse about the
woods and fields, and are then not readily discovered.</p>

<p>A young bird (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 53,355, East Humboldt Mountains, Nevada, August 5)
is olive-gray above, becoming green on the rump and upper tail-coverts; the
middle and secondary coverts narrowly tipped with pale grayish-buff, producing
two indistinct bands. The lower parts are pale dirty-buff, except the
<!--249.png--><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 200]</span>
lower tail-coverts, which are lemon-yellow; there is scarcely a tinge of yellow
on the jugulum, and not a trace of chestnut on the crown.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> But little is as yet known in regard to the habits and distribution
of this somewhat rare and recently discovered species. It was first met with
by Dr. W. W. Anderson, at Fort Burgwyn in New Mexico, and described
by Professor Baird in 1860, in a note to the explanation of <abbr title="Volume Two">Vol. II.</abbr> of the
Birds of North America. It was named in honor of Mrs. Virginia Anderson,
the wife of its discoverer. An immature individual of this species was
obtained August 15, 1864, by Dr. Coues, at Fort Whipple, near Prescott, in
the Territory of Arizona. As it bears a close resemblance to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Helminthophaga
ruficapilla</i>, it is not improbable that its habits bear a very close
resemblance to those of that species.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1869, Mr. Robert Ridgway was so fortunate as to meet
with the nest and eggs of this bird near Salt Lake, Utah (<abbr title="Smithsonian Collection">Smith. Coll.</abbr>
15,239). This was June 9. The nest was embedded in the deposits of
dead or decaying leaves, on ground covered by dense oak-brush. Its rim
was just even with the surface. It was built on the side of a narrow ravine
at the bottom of which was a small stream. The nest itself is two inches
in depth by three and a half in diameter. It consists of a loose but intricate
interweaving of fine strips of the inner bark of the mountain mahogany,
fine stems of grasses, roots, and mosses, and is lined with the same
with the addition of the fur and hair of the smaller animals.</p>

<p>The eggs were four in number, and measure .64 by .47 of an inch. They
are of a rounded-ovoid shape, have a white ground with a slightly roseate
tinge, and are profusely spotted with numerous small blotches and dots of
purplish-brown and lilac, forming a crown around the larger end.</p>

<p>This bird was first observed by Mr. Ridgway among the cedars and pines
of the East Humboldt Mountains, where in July it was quite common. It
was very abundant in the Wahsatch Mountains near Salt Lake City, throughout
the summer chiefly inhabiting the thickets of scrub-oak on the slopes of
the cañons in which they nested, and where they were daily seen, but where,
owing to the thickness of the bushes, they were with difficulty obtained. He
describes its song as almost exactly like that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroica æstiva</i>. The
usual note is a soft <i class="birdcall">pit</i>, quite different from the sharp <i class="birdcall">chip</i> of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. celata</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Fort Mohave, Colorado River (Middle Province of United States); Fort Whipple,
Arizona.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This is also a new or recently discovered species of this interesting
group of Warblers. In regard to its nest and eggs nothing is positively
ascertained, yet as all the birds of this genus are known to build on the
ground, and to have a great uniformity in the characteristics of their eggs, it
seems to be a matter of natural inference that this species also is a ground
builder, and has eggs similar to those of the Nashville Warbler. For the
little we know in regard to its habits and distribution, we are indebted to
the observations of Dr. J. G. Cooper of California, who first discovered it,
and to Dr. Coues, who has since met with it in Arizona.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper first observed this species near Fort Mohave, where it made its
appearance about the last of March. His attention was called to it by its
peculiar notes, resembling those of some <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroicæ</i>, but fainter. After considerable
watching and scrambling through dense mezquite thickets in its
pursuit, he succeeded in shooting one, and found it to be a new species.
Afterwards they became more numerous, frequenting the tops of the mezquite-trees
in pursuit of insects, and constantly uttering their short but
pleasing notes. About ten days after the first appearance of the males, Dr.
Cooper obtained the first female, and thinks that without doubt they are
much later in their migrations, as is the case with other Warblers. He
was not able to discover their nest, having to leave the valley late in
May.</p>

<p>Mr. Holden obtained other specimens of this bird, near the 34th parallel,
in March of 1863.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues met with three individuals of this species near Fort Whipple,
where it is a summer resident. It arrives there between the 15th and the
20th of April, and remains until the latter part of September. It mates
about the last of April, and the young birds appear early in June.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues regards its habits as more like those of the true Ground Warblers
than those of the other species of this group. It shows a decided
preference for thickets and copses, rather than for high open woods, and is
also an exceedingly shy and retiring species. To the extreme difficulty of
observing or procuring it Dr. Coues attributes its having so long remained
unnoticed.</p>

<p>It is described as exceedingly active in all its motions, and quite as restless
as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polioptila</i>, to which class, in its colors, it also bears a close resemblance.
<!--251.png--><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 202]</span>
The only note Dr. Coues ever heard it utter was a quick and often
repeated <i class="birdcall">tsip</i>, as slender and as wiry as that of a Gnatcatcher. Dr. Cooper,
however, has described its song as rich and pleasing, the little performer being
mounted on the top of some mezquite or other bush. Dr. Cooper supposes
this species to breed, not in the Colorado Valley, but in the more mountainous
regions.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues hazards the conjecture that this bird builds in low bushes.
Should it prove so, it would in this respect differ from all the other members
of this well-marked group, and from the other Ground Warblers, which, in its
general habits, it so much resembles.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Middle Province of North America; Yukon and McKenzie River district. Very
rare in the Eastern Province of United States; Mexico in winter; Oaxaca, La Parada,
(<span class="sc">Sclater</span>); Orizaba, winter (<span class="sc">Sumichrast</span>).</p>

<p>This variety inhabits the interior regions of North America, from the
Yukon southward into Mexico; westward, its range meets that of the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lutescens</i> at about the meridian of 116<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, while eastward it extends beyond the
Mississippi, though rare east of the latter region. Specimens from Southern
Illinois (where it is abundant in its migrations) and from Wisconsin are precisely
like Rocky Mountain examples; but several in the collection before us
from the South Atlantic States (Florida, Georgia, etc.) are so different as almost
to warrant their separation as a different variety. These individuals are most
like the style of the interior,&mdash;<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">celata</i>,&mdash;but are even less yellowish, and
the whole plumage is very dark and dingy; all of them, too, lack any trace
whatever of orange on the crown. Should all specimens from this region
agree in the latter respect, the series from the Southeastern States is certainly
entitled to recognition as a variety, for which we propose the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obscura</i>.</p>

<p><!--252.png--><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 203]</span>
<span class="sc">Habits.</span> The geographical distribution of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. celata</i> is involved in some
doubt, owing probably to its irregularity of migration. In a few occasional
instances this species has been observed in the Atlantic States. Several have
been obtained near Philadelphia. Mr. Audubon affirms to having seen it in
the Middle States about the 10th of May, and in Maine later in the month.
Beyond that he did not trace it. Mr. J. A. Allen procured one specimen of
this bird in Springfield, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, May 15, 1863. There were quite a number
among the fruit-trees of the garden and orchard, then in bloom, and, mistaking
them for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Helminthophaga ruficapilla</i>, he at first neglected to shoot any,
until, being in doubt, he procured one, and found it the Orange-Crown. The
group passed on, and one was all he obtained. It is not given by Mr.
Turnbull as one of the birds of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, nor by Mr.
Boardman or Professor Verrill as occurring in Maine. I am informed by
Mr. Ridgway that it is a regular spring and autumn migrant in Southern
Illinois, and in some seasons is quite common.</p>

<p>It was taken as a migratory species at Oaxaca, Mexico, during the winter
months, by M. A. Boucard.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon’s account of the habits and movements of this species must
be received with much caution. His description of its nest is entirely inaccurate,
and much that he attributes to this species we have reason to believe
relates to the habits of other birds.</p>

<p>On the Pacific coast it seems to be quite abundant, at different seasons,
from Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas to the arctic regions, where it breeds. Mr. Kennicott
obtained several specimens at Fort Yukon and at Fort Resolution, and Mr.
Boss met with them at Fort Simpson. Xantus obtained these birds both at
Fort Tejon and at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas. It is common in Southern California
during the winter, frequenting low bushes and the margins of streams. Dr.
Gambel met with it in early spring on the island of Santa Catalina, where
he had an opportunity of listening to its simple and lively song. This he
describes as commencing in a low, sweet trill, and ending in <i class="birdcall">tshe-up</i>. It
is sometimes considerably varied, but is described as generally resembling
<i class="birdcall">er-r,r,r,r-shè-up</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper speaks of this Warbler as an abundant and constant resident
of California, near the coast, and found in summer throughout the Sierra
Nevada. In March they begin to sing their simple trill, which, he says, is
rather musical, and audible for a long distance.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues met with this Warbler in Arizona, at Fort Yuma, September 17,
at Fort Mohave, October 1, and also at the head-waters of Bill Williams
River. Lieutenant Couch found it at Brownsville, <abbr title="Texas">Tex.</abbr>, seeking its food
and making its home among the low shrubbery.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley found it very abundant at Fort Steilacoom, in Washington
Territory, where it kept in shady places among thick brush, generally in the
vicinity of watercourses. Dr. Heermann found a few pairs incubating near
the summits of the highest mountains on the Colorado River. The nests of
<!--253.png--><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 204]</span>
this species, seen by Mr. Kennicott, were uniformly on the ground, generally
among clumps of low bushes, often in the side of a bank, and usually hidden
by the dry leaves among which they were placed. He met with these nests
in the middle of June in the vicinity of Great Slave Lake. They were large
for the size of the bird, having an external diameter of four inches, and a
height of two and a half, and appearing as if made of two or three distinct
fabrics, one within the other, of nearly the same materials. The external
portions of these nests were composed almost entirely of long, coarse
strips of bark loosely interwoven with a few dry grasses and stems of plants.
Within it is a more elaborately interwoven structure of finer dry grasses and
mosses. These are softly and warmly lined with hair and fur of small
animals.</p>

<p>Nests from more arctic regions are of a different style of structure, homogeneous
in materials,&mdash;which are chiefly stems of small plants and the finer
grasses,&mdash;and are of a more compact make and smaller in size.</p>

<p>Their eggs are from four to six in number, and vary in length from .70
to .60 of an inch, and in breadth from .50 to .45 of an inch. They have
a clear white ground, marked with spots and small blotches of reddish-brown
and fainter marking of purplish-slate. The number of spots varies
greatly, some eggs being nearly unspotted, others profusely covered.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway met with this Warbler in great abundance during its autumnal
migration among the shrubbery along the streams of the Sierra Nevada,
at all altitudes. In summer it was only seen among the high aspen woods
on the Wahsatch Mountains. Fully fledged young birds were numerous in
July and August. Their usual note was a sharp <i class="birdcall">chip</i>.</p>

<p>This bird was found breeding near Fort Resolution, on the Yukon, at
Fort Rae, and at Fort Anderson.</p>

<p>Autumnal specimens and young birds are sometimes so strongly tinged
with greenish-yellow as to be scarcely distinguishable from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. celata</i>. The
wing is, however, always longer, and the obscure whitish patch on the
inner edge of the exterior tail-feather, near its tip, is almost always appreciable.
In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">celata</i> this edge is very narrowly and uniformly margined
with whitish.</p>

<p>A young bird of the year, from Port Simpson (27,228), has two distinct
greenish-white bands on the wings, and the forehead and cheeks greenish-yellow.
A corresponding age of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. celata</i> has the wing-bands more reddish-brown,
the wings shorter, and no white patch on the outer tail-feather.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Like the Nashville Warbler the present species has received a
name inappropriate to one with so northern a distribution. It was first obtained
on the banks of the Cumberland River by Wilson, and has since been
known as the Tennessee Warbler. But two specimens were ever obtained
by him, and he regarded it as a very rare species. He found them hunting
<!--255.png--><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 206]</span>
nimbly among the young leaves, and thought they possessed many of the
habits of the Titmice. Their notes he described as few and weak, and in
their stomachs he found, upon dissection, small green caterpillars and a few
winged insects.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon also regarded it as a rare species, and only three specimens
ever fell within his observations. These were obtained in Louisiana and at
Key West. He describes them as appearing to be nimble, active birds, expert
catchers of flies, and fond of hanging to the extremities of branches,
uttering a single mellow <i class="birdcall">tweet</i> as they fly from branch to branch in search of
food, or while on the wing.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall appears not to have met with it. Dr. Richardson procured
only a single specimen at Cumberland House, in the latter part of May.
This was in a dense thicket of small trees, and was flying about among the
lower branches. He was unable to discover its nest, or to learn anything in
regard to its habits.</p>

<p>A little more light has since then been given both as to its geographical
distribution and its mode of nesting. Specimens of this species have been
obtained in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Oaxaca, Mexico, and Panama. A specimen
of this species was also taken in Colombia, <abbr title="South America">S. A.</abbr>, by Mr. C. W. Wyatt.
Dr. Gundlach mentions it as occasionally found in Cuba. Mr. Drexler
secured specimens of it at Moose Factory and at Fort George in the arctic
regions. Specimens were taken by Mr. Bernard R. Ross at Fort Simpson.
Mr. Robert Kennicott met with it on the northern shores of Lake Winnipeg,
June 6. They were then abundant, and had already mated. He again
met with them at Fort Resolution, and Mr. Clarke found them at Fort Rae,
Mr. W. F. Hall in Maine, Mr. Bell on the Upper Missouri, and Professor
Baird in Pennsylvania. Mr. Ridgway has obtained it both in spring and in
fall in Southern Illinois, where it is abundant in some seasons. It does not
appear to occur on the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>Mr. Boardman writes that the Tennessee Warbler is, in the summer time,
quite a common bird in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephens and vicinity. Its notes, he adds, resemble
the low, subdued whistle of the common Summer Yellow-Bird.</p>

<p>Mr. Maynard found this Warbler very common near Lake Umbagog during
the breeding-season. It was found in all the wooded localities in the
regions north of the neighboring mountains. Its song, he states, resembles
that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. ruficapilla</i>, the notes of the first part being more divided, while
the latter part is shriller.</p>

<p>A nest of this Warbler (<abbr title="Smithsonian Collection">Smith. Coll.</abbr>, 3476), obtained on the northern shore
of Lake Superior by Mr. George Barnston, is but little more than a nearly flat
bed of dry, matted stems of grass, and is less than an inch in thickness, with
a diameter of about three inches. It is not circular in shape, and its width
is not uniform. Its position must have been on some flat surface, probably
the ground. The eggs resemble those of all the family in having a white
ground, over which are profusely distributed numerous small dots and points
<!--256.png--><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 207]</span>
of a reddish-brown, and a few of a purplish-slate. They are of an oblong-oval
shape, and measure .68 by .50 of an inch.</p>

<p>A nest from near Springfield, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, obtained by Professor Horsford, the
parent bird having been secured, was built in a low clump of bushes, just
above the ground. It is well made, woven of fine hempen fibres of vegetables,
slender stems of grass, delicate mosses, and other like materials, and
very thoroughly lined with hair. It measures two and three fourths inches
in diameter and two in height. The cavity is two inches wide and one and
three fourths deep. The eggs measure .60 by .50 of an inch, are oblong-oval
in shape, their ground-color a pearly white, marked in a corona, about
the larger end, with brown and purplish-brown spots.</p>

In the species of this genus the bill is conical and acute; the culmen
very gently curved from the base; the commissure slightly concave. The notch when
visible is further from the tip than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroica</i>, but usually is either obsolete or entirely
wanting. Bristles weak. The tarsi are longer than the middle toe. The tail is nearly
even, and considerably shorter than the wing. Color, blue above, with a triangular patch
of green on the back; anterior lower parts yellow.</p>

<p>Two species&mdash;one with three varieties&mdash;of this genus, as lately restricted,

there is frequently (as in 58,335, Philadelphia)
a well-defined, broad blackish
band across the jugulum, anterior to an

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Blue Yellow-Back is one of our most interesting and attractive
Warblers. Nowhere very abundant, it has a well-marked and restricted
area within which it is sparingly distributed. It is found from the Mississippi
Valley to the Atlantic, and from Canada southward. In its winter
migrations it visits the West Indies, the Bahamas, and Central and South
America. Halifax on the east, and Platte River on the west, appear to be
the northern limit of its distribution. Dr. Woodhouse met with it in the
Indian Territory during the breeding-season. Mr. Alfred Newton found this
species, apparently only a winter visitant, in the island of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix. Most
of the birds left about the middle of March, though a few remained until
early in May.</p>

<p>A single specimen of this species was taken at South Greenland in
1857.</p>

<p>This Warbler has been found breeding as far to the south as Tuckertown,
<abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr>, by Mr. W. S. Wood; and at Cape May, in the same State, by Mr.
John Krider. At Washington, Dr. Coues found it only a spring and autumn
visitant, exceedingly abundant from April 25 to May 15. Possibly a
few remained to breed, as he met with them in the first week of August.
In the fall they were again abundant from August 25 to the second week in
October. He found them inhabiting exclusively high open woods, and
usually seen in the tops of the trees, or at the extremities of the branches,
in the tufts of leaves and blossoms.</p>

<p>Even where most common it is not an abundant species, and is to be found
only in certain localities, somewhat open and swampy thickets, usually not
of great extent, and prefers those well covered with the long gray lichens
known as Spanish moss. In such localities only, so far as I know, do they
breed.</p>

<p>This Warbler has also been ascertained to breed in Southern Illinois, where
Mr. Ridgway found it in July, engaged in feeding fully fledged young birds.
It is there most common in spring and fall.</p>

<p><!--259.png--><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 210]</span>
A true Warbler in most of its attributes, this bird has many of the habits of
Titmice. Like these it frequents the tops of the taller trees, feeding on the
small winged insects and caterpillars that abound among the young leaves
and blossoms. It has no song, properly so called, its notes are feeble and
few, and can be heard only a short distance.</p>

<p>The song of this species is said by Mr. Trippe, of Orange, <abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr>, to
be a somewhat sharp and lisping, yet quite varied and pleasing, series of
notes.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon speaks of this species as breeding in Louisiana, but his
description of the nest differs so entirely from such as are met with in Massachusetts
as to suggest doubts as to the correctness of the identification.
He describes them as flitting over damp places, the edges of ponds and
streams, and pursuing their prey with great activity. They resort to the
woods as soon as the foliage appears on the forest trees, and glean among the
leaves for the smaller winged insects.</p>

<p>The nests of this Warbler, so far as has fallen under my observation, have
always been made of long gray lichens still attached to the trees on which
they grow. With great skill do these tiny architects gather up, fasten
together, and interweave, one with the other, the hanging ends and longer
branches. By an elaborate intertwining of these long fibres they form the
principal part, sometimes the whole, of their nests. These structures are at
once simple, beautiful, ingenious, and skilfully wrought. When first made,
they are somewhat rude and unfinished, but as their family are gathered,
the eggs deposited, incubated, and hatched, a change has been going on. Little
by little has the male bird busied himself, when not procuring food for
his mate, in improving, strengthening, and enlarging the nest. These same
acts of improvement upon the original nests are noticed with Humming-Birds,
Vireos, and a few other birds.</p>

<p>The nests are sometimes constructed on the sides of trunks of trees, when
covered with the long gray lichens, but are more frequently found hanging
from branches usually not more than six or eight feet from the ground.
Thus surrounded by long hanging mosses in clumps not distinguishable from
the nests themselves, they would not be readily recognized were it not that
those familiar with the habits of the bird may be readily guided to the spot
by the artless movements of the unsuspecting parents.</p>

<p>These birds are confiding, easily approached, and rarely exhibit any signs of
alarm. Even when their nest is disturbed they make but little complaint, and
do not manifest any very great signs of emotion. When built against a trunk
these nests consist only of an interweaving of the moss above and below a
very small opening, within which a small cup-shaped flooring has been made
of the same material, and usually cannot be removed without destroying all
semblance of a nest. When pensile they are imperfectly circular in shape,
with an entrance on one side, and rarely with any lining. Occasionally they
are models of symmetry and beauty.</p>

<p><!--260.png--><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 211]</span>
The eggs, four or five in number, have a clear white ground, and are sparingly
spotted with markings of reddish-brown, slate, purple, and lilac. In
some the first predominate, in other the last three shades are more abundant,
and usually form a confluent ring around the larger end. They measure from
.62 to .65 of an inch in length, and from .49 to .50 in breadth.</p>

Form of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroica</i>, but bill slender, acute, with very obsolete notch; the
commissure gently arched or curved from the base;
the gonys also straight, or even slightly concave.
Tongue lengthened, narrow, deeply bifid (for one

at the end; the edge along the median portion folded
over on the upper surface, but not adherent.</p>

<p>The curvature of the bill in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Perissoglossa

even slightly concave.</p>

<p>It is most probable that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Helinaia carbonata</i> of Audubon belongs here,

Bill very acute, conical, and decidedly curved. Bill and feet black. Upper
part of head dull black, some of the feathers faintly margined with light yellowish-brown.
Collar scarcely meeting behind; rump and under parts generally rich yellow. Throat, forepart
of breast, and sides, streaked with black. Abdomen and lower tail-coverts pale yellow,
brighter about the vent. Ear-coverts light reddish-chestnut. Back part of a yellow
line from nostrils over the eye of this same color; chin and throat tinged also with it. A
black line from commissure through the eye, and running into the chestnut of the ear-coverts.
Back, shoulder, edges of the wing and tail, yellowish-olive; the former spotted
with dusky. One row of small coverts, and outer bases of the secondary coverts, form a
large patch of white, tinged with pale yellow. Tertials rather broadly edged with brownish-white.
Quills and tail dark brown, the three outer feathers of the latter largely marked
with white on the inner web; edge of the outer web of the outer feathers white, more
perceptible towards the base. Length, 5.25; wing, 2.84; tail, 2.15.</p>

<p class="small"><i class="sex">Female.</i> Above olivaceous-ash, most yellowish on rump; no black nor chestnut on
head. Wing-coverts inconspicuously edged with whitish. Tail-spots very inconspicuous.
Beneath dull white tinged with yellowish on the breast, and streaked as in the male,
but with dusky grayish instead of black.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern Province of United States, north to Lake Winnipeg and Moose Factory;
all the West Indies to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix. Breeds in Jamaica. Not recorded from Mexico or Central
America.</p>

<p>The chestnut about the head in adult males varies in amount with the
individual; sometimes (as in 20,633, May, Moose Factory, Hudson’s Bay Territory)
there is an oblong spot of chestnut in the middle of the crown, but
generally this is absent. Very frequently the chestnut tinges the throat. All
variations in these respects appear, however, to be individual, and not dependent
at all on locality. West Indian specimens appear to be absolutely
identical with those from North America.</p>

<p>Autumnal specimens are browner, the chestnut markings much obscured.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This somewhat rare species, so far as its history and distribution
are known with certainty, is migratory in the principal portions of the United
<!--263.png--><!--blank page-->

States, in the spring and fall passing to the north of the <abbr title="forty-second">42d</abbr> parallel to
breed. The first specimen was obtained near the extreme southern point of
New Jersey by George Ord, in 1811, and described and figured by Wilson.
From this accidental circumstance it derives its inappropriate name of Cape
May Warbler. Wilson never met with a second specimen, and Mr. Nuttall
was wholly unacquainted with it. Mr. Audubon also never met with a specimen
in all his wanderings, and was able to add nothing to its history. Those
figured by him were procured by Mr. Edward Harris, near Philadelphia,
through which region these birds appear to pass rapidly in their northern
migrations.</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. Allen obtained a specimen near Springfield, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, May 15,
1863, and specimens have also been procured at East Windsor Hill, <abbr title="Connecticut">Conn.</abbr>,
by Dr. Wood. It was not met with in Western Maine by Mr. Verrill, but in
Eastern Maine and in New Brunswick Mr. Boardman has found it a not uncommon
summer visitant, though of irregular frequency. He has no doubt
that they remain there to breed. They reach Calais as early as the second
week in May, or as early as their appearance usually in the neighborhood of
Philadelphia has been noticed. Mr. Kumlien has also obtained specimens
from year to year, about the middle of May, in Southern Wisconsin, where
they do not remain to breed, and Mr. Ridgway has taken them in the
beginning of May in Southern Illinois.</p>

<p>It is also by no means uncommon in Cuba; was met by the Newtons as
a migrant in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix, and is not only one of the birds of Jamaica, but is
resident and breeds in the highlands of that island. It is not known to
occur in Central America, Mexico, or west of the Mississippi River. Specimens
were procured at Moose Factory about May 28.</p>

<p>Its nests and eggs have not been, with certainty, obtained in the United
States, though an egg obtained in Coventry, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, in 1836, and attributed at
the time to this bird, closely resembles its identified eggs from Jamaica.
Specimens of the bird, as well as its nests and eggs, have also been received
from <abbr title="Santo">St.</abbr> Domingo by Mr. Turnbull of Philadelphia. In the summer of
1871 a nest of this species was found by Mr. H. B. Bailey on the Richardson
Lakes, in the extreme northwestern part of Maine. The nest was in a
low spruce-tree, less than five feet from the ground, and when found contained
only a single egg. Unfortunately it was left until more eggs were
deposited, and in the mean while the tree was cut, and the nest and eggs were
destroyed.</p>

<p>Mr. W. T. March of Jamaica, in his notes on the birds of that island,
states that this species may always be found, in its various changes of plumage,
about the mangrove swamps and river-banks. During the summer
months it was common about Healthshire and Great Salt Pond, and at other
times very generally distributed over the island. He also met with several
specimens of its nests and eggs, but their position was not stated. The nests
had apparently been taken from a bush or tree, were three and one fourth
<!--265.png--><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 214]</span>
inches in diameter by two and one half in height, with cavities unusually
large and deep for the size of the nests. They were wrought almost entirely
of long strips of thin flexible bark, strongly and firmly interwoven. The
outer portions consisted of coarser and longer strips, the inner being much
finer and more delicate. With the outer portions were also interwoven bits
of mosses, lichens, and the outer bark of deciduous trees. The entire fabric
was a remarkable one.</p>

<p>The eggs measure .70 by .55 of an inch, have a pinkish-white ground,
blotched with purple and brown of various shades and tints. They are disposed
chiefly about the larger end, usually in a ring. The eggs are oval in
shape and slightly pointed at one end.</p>

Bill brownish-black above, light blue beneath. Iris hazel. Feet light flesh-color.
Upper part of the head black. Forepart of the back, lesser wing-coverts, and
sides dusky, spotted with black. Lower back dull yellowish-green, as is the tail, of
which the outer web of the outer feather is whitish. Tip of the second row of coverts
white, of the first row yellow; quills dusky, their outer webs tinged with yellow. A line
from the lore over the eye; sides of the neck and the throat bright yellow. A dusky line
behind the eye. The rest of the under parts dull yellow, excepting the sides. Length, 4.75
inches; bill above, 4.42; tarsus, .75. (<span class="sc">Audubon</span>).</p>

<p>This species continues to be known only by the description and figure of
Audubon.</p>

<p>Judging from the description, this species is closely related to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. tigrina</i>,
but seems to be distinct in the pure black of the top of the head, the absence
of orange-brown on the cheeks, the white of the wing being on the middle
coverts instead of the greater, and the tail-feathers being yellowish-green;
the outer web of outer feather white, instead of a large spot on the inner
web, etc. The back appears more distinctly streaked.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Two specimens of this Warbler, obtained near Henderson, <abbr title="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr>,
May, 1811, by Mr. Audubon, are all its claim to be recognized as a good
species. None have since been seen. These birds are described as having
been busily engaged in collecting insects among the branches of a dogwood
tree. Their motions were like those of other Warblers. This is all we as
yet know as to the history of this species, and its claims to be regarded as
a good and distinct species are involved in doubt.</p>

Bill conical, attenuated, depressed at the base, where it is, however, scarcely
broader than high, compressed from the middle.
Culmen straight for the basal half, then
rather rapidly curving, the lower edge of upper
mandible also concave. Gonys slightly
convex and ascending. A distinct notch near
the end of the bill. Bristles, though short,
generally quite distinct at the base of the bill.
Tarsi long; decidedly longer than middle
toe, which is longer than the hinder one;
the claws rather small and much curved;
the hind claw nearly as long as its digit.
The wings long and pointed; the second quill
usually a very little longer than the first. The tail slightly rounded and emarginate.</p>

<p class="small"><i class="subset">Colors.</i> Tail always with a white or yellow spot; its ground-color never clear olive-green.
In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. æstiva</i> edged internally with yellow.</p>

<p class="small">Eggs usually with a white or a bluish-white ground, marked with purplish-brown and
obscure lilac; in some, mingled with varying shades of sienna-brown. Nest, so far as
known, in bushes and trees, except <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. palmarum</i>, which is on the ground.</p>

<p>The genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroica</i> is one of the most extensive as to species of any in
North America, and scarcely admits of any subdivision. There is a little variation
in the bill, wings, etc., the chief peculiarities being in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. castanea</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pennsylvanica</i>, in which the bill is broader, and more depressed, with longer
bristles; in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. striata</i>, where the bill is narrow with scarcely any bristles; and
in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. palmarum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">kirtlandi</i>, where the wings are very short, scarcely
longer than the tail. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. palmarum</i> has
the tarsus unusually long. The colors
in all are strongly marked, and the species
are among the most beautiful of
all belonging to our fauna, and are the
most conspicuous for their numbers and
in their migrations.</p>

<p>The difference in manners between
certain members of this genus is remarkable;
thus, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. palmarum</i> is
very terrestrial in its habits, walking
upon the ground with the ease and
grace of a Titlark (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthus</i>), and, like
these birds, it has a wagging motion
of the tail. On the other hand, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroica dominica</i> is as much a
<!--267.png--><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 216]</span>
Creeper as is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mniotilta varia</i>; creeping not only along the branches, but
the cornices and lattices of buildings, with the facility of a Nuthatch (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitta</i>).
Both these species, however, may often be seen hopping among the foliage
of the trees, now and then snapping an insect on the wing, in the manner
of others of the family.</p>

Entire North America, and in winter into South America as far as Ecuador,

<p>In the great abundance of this species and its wide range of distribution,
there are many variations in size and color, though none that are not readily
understood. In young birds the yellow of the tail-feathers is more restricted,
sometimes confined to the edge of the inner webs. In adults there is occasionally
a tinge of orange in the forehead.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvia rathbonia</i> of Audubon is described with even tail, and the tail-feathers
brown, edged externally with yellow; the reverse of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æstiva</i>. It is generally,
however, considered a synonyme.</p>

<p>Birds of this type (“Golden Warblers”) of six or eight additional species
are known to occur in the West Indies, the Galapagos, and in Middle America;
one of them, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. bryanti</i>, possibly to be met with in Southern Arizona. (See
Baird, Review <abbr title="American">Am.</abbr> Birds, 193.)</p>

<p>After comparing a series of about one hundred and twenty North and
Central American specimens (the latter being winter visitors to the region
where obtained), nothing really characteristic of any particular region can
be detected. Specimens from the Pacific coast of the United States are perfectly
identical in colors with those from the Atlantic States; and they agree
in size and proportions, except of the bill, which is appreciably longer and
broader in the Eastern than in the Western birds. The most highly colored
examples are from the interior regions, along the Mississippi Valley from
Louisiana to Northern Illinois, and over the plains north to Fort Simpson.
The majority of the specimens from this region are just appreciably different
from others, in having the yellow more intense and prevalent, almost subduing
the olive shades above; the crown more tinged with orange. Sometimes
(as in <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4,301, Calcasieu Pass, <abbr title="Louisiana">La.</abbr>) the rump and upper tail-coverts
are absolutely <em>pure</em> yellow, only a medial stripe on the feathers being olivaceous
like the back. The orange-rufous tinge on the crown is deepest in
Nos. 4,665, Fort Lookout, and 4,300, Calcasieu Pass.</p>

<p>Three adult summer males from Alaska (Nos. 54,429, Kodiak; 54,425,
Yukon River; and 27,267, Fort Yukon), as well as one from Maine (52,378,
Calais), differ from others in having the olive pervading the whole surface
above, even to the bill, the forehead being only tinged with yellow, and the
edges of wing-coverts merely inclining to this color. The lower parts are
much as in Southern specimens, though the yellow is less intense.</p>

<p>Females from Arizona (as 49,712, Camp Grant, May; 40,664, Fort Whipple,
May; and 34,340, Los Pinos, New Mexico, June) differ from others in
very bleached plumage, the lower parts being almost white, and the upper
<!--275.png--><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 224]</span>
surface quite ashy. But this is, in fact, an actual bleaching, frequently to be
seen in birds from that region.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The geographical range of the common Summer Yellow-Bird is
very nearly coextensive with North America. In its northern distribution
it is found as far toward the arctic shores as any of our land birds. Richardson
speaks of it as well known throughout the fur countries as far as the
woods extend, and mentions meeting with it among the earliest arrivals in
spring, coming in company with the equally well-known Robin and the
Grakle. At Fort Franklin, latitude 66<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, he saw it the 15th of May, about
the time of its first appearance in New England. This was supposed to be
the limit of its northern range, but more recent observations give abundant
evidence of its presence, in considerable numbers, to the very shores of the
Arctic Ocean. The late Mr. Hepburn, in manuscript notes, states it to be a
common summer visitant both of California and Vancouver’s Island, and that
along the coast he has traced it as far north as the frontier line of 54<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> 40<abbr title="minutes">′</abbr>,
where it arrives at the beginning of May, but does not nest until the end of
the month.</p>

<p>Mr. Dall, in his notes on the birds of Alaska, states that this Warbler is a
rather common bird all through that territory, and gives its arrival as about
the 10th of May.</p>

<p>Its extreme southern limit is not so distinctly traced, but is at least as far
as the northern portions of South America, inclusive of Cayenne and Ecuador.
In all of the West Indies except Trinidad it is replaced by several closely
allied species or local races. In Trinidad, Mr. E. C. Taylor states that he
found this species common, and could perceive no difference from North
American specimens. In Guatemala it is abundant in the winter.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found this Warbler abundant in Arizona, where it is a summer
resident, from April 25 to the middle of September. There, as elsewhere,
its preference for watercourses was noticed. Wherever found, it is always
most abundant in alluvial meadows, and more rare in other localities.</p>

<p>Dr. Samuel Cabot found this Warbler common in Central America, and
Dr. Cragin, of Surinam, sent the Boston Society several specimens from
Guiana. Dr. Woodhouse found it abundant in Texas and New Mexico,
as did Drs. Suckley and Cooper in Washington Territory and California. It
breeds over the whole area of North America, from Georgia on the southeast
and from Mexico, northward. Dr. Sumichrast found it, only as a migratory
bird, abundant on the plains of Mexico.</p>

<p>The notes of Mr. Kennicott and the memoranda of Messrs. McFarlane,
Ross, and Lockhart attest the extreme abundance of this species in the farthest
Arctic regions. In nearly every instance the nests were placed in willows
from two to five feet from the ground, and near water. In one instance Mr.
Ross found the eggs of this species in the nest of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus swainsoni</i>, which
had either been deserted or the parent killed, as the eggs were in it, and would
probably have been hatched by the Warbler with her own.</p>

<p><!--276.png--><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 225]</span>
Dr. Cooper found this Warbler very abundant in Washington Territory,
and noticed their arrival in large numbers at the Straits of Fuca as early
as April 8.</p>

<p>The Summer Yellow-Bird arrives in New England with great uniformity
from the first to the middle of May. Its coming is usually the harbinger of
the opening summer and expanding leaves. Unlike most of its family, it is
confiding and familiar, easily encouraged, by attention to its wants, to cultivate
the society of man. It confidingly builds its nest in gardens, often in close
vicinity to dwellings, and in the midst of large villages and cities, among the
shrubbery of frequented parks. This Warbler, soon after its arrival, begins
the construction of its nest. It is usually placed in low bushes, three or four
feet from the ground. Occasionally very different positions are chosen.
Hedges of buckthorn and hawthorn, barberry-bushes, and other low shrubs,
are their favorite places of resort. On one occasion the nest was placed
some forty feet from the ground, in the top of a horse-chestnut tree overhanging
the main street of a village. Such high positions are, however,
not very common.</p>

<p>The nest is invariably fastened to several twigs with great firmness, and
with a remarkable neatness and skill. A great variety of materials is employed
in the construction of their nests, though not often in the same nest,
which is usually quite homogeneous. The more common materials are the
hempen fibres of plants, fibrous strips of bark, slender stems of plants and
leaves, and down of asclepias. Interwoven with these, forming the inner
materials, are the down from willow catkins, the woolly furze from fern-stalks
and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eriophorum virginicum</i>, and similar substances. These are lined with
soft, fine grasses, hair, feathers, and other warm materials. Cotton, where
procurable, is a favorite material; as also is wool, where abundant. I have
known instances where nests were built almost exclusively of one or the
other material. A pair of these birds, in 1836, built their nest under a parlor
window in Roxbury, where all their operations could be closely watched.
When discovered, only the framework, the fastening to the supporting twigs,
had been erected. The work of completion was simple and rapid. The
female was the chief builder, taking her position in the centre of the nest
and arranging the materials in their places as her mate brought them to her.
Occasionally, with outstretched wings and expanded tail, she would whirl
herself round, giving to the soft and yielding materials their hemispherical
form. At intervals she arrested her revolutions to stop and regulate with
her bill some unyielding portion. When her mate was dilatory, she made
brief excursions and collected material for herself, and when the materials
brought her were deemed unsuitable, they were rejected in a most summary
and amusing manner. The important part of the tail-feathers in shaping the
nest and placing the materials in position was a striking feature in this interesting
performance. The greater portion of the nest was thus constructed
in a single day.</p>

The wonderful sagacity displayed by this Warbler in avoiding the disagreeable
alternative of either having to abandon its own nest or of rearing
the young of the intrusive Cow Blackbird, when one of these eggs is dropped
in her nest, was first noticed by Mr. Nuttall. The egg of the parasite, being
too large for ejectment, is ingeniously incarcerated in the bottom of the nest,
and a new lining built over it. Occasionally, either by accident or design,
the intrusive egg has been fractured. Mr. Nuttall states that where the
parasitic egg is laid after her own, the Summer Yellow-Bird acts faithfully
the part of a foster-parent. This, however, is not according to my observations.
In several instances I have known the Summer Yellow-Bird utterly
refuse to act the part of a foster-parent, and, rather than do so, sacrifice her
own eggs. So far as I know, this Warbler will never sit upon or hatch out
the egg of the Cowbird, under any circumstances. Some powerful instinct,
bordering closely upon reason, seems to teach these intelligent Warblers the
character of the intruder, and they sacrifice their own eggs rather than rear
the parasite. In this dilemma they will always, so far as I know, incarcerate
their own eggs with the Cowbird’s and reconstruct the nest above them.
In one instance the same pair of Yellow-Birds twice, in the same nest, covered
up alien eggs in this manner, building, in fact, three nests one above
the other, between the walls of which had been successively included two
eggs of the Cowbird. This three-storied nest measured seven inches in
length, and was built almost exclusively of raw cotton. The covering of the
imprisoned eggs was about two thirds of an inch thick. In both instances
the Cowbird’s eggs had been broken, apparently by design.</p>

<p>So far as I am aware this Warbler raises but one brood in Massachusetts
in a season. In Pennsylvania it is said to raise two, and even three. The
eggs are usually five and occasionally six in number.</p>

<p>This Warbler is conspicuous in its devotion to its young, evincing a strong
attachment and an anxiety in regard even to an unoccupied nest, and betraying
the site by this solicitude. They will also resort to various expedients
to draw one away from their nest, by feigned lameness and other stratagems
and manœuvres.</p>

<p>The song of the Summer Yellow-Bird is simple but pleasing, and is easily
recognized when once known, though liable to be confounded with that of the
Maryland Yellow-Throat, and also said to resemble the song of several other
Warblers.</p>

<p>In confinement they usually become very tame, confiding, and reconciled
to their imprisonment, and have been known to perch on an outstretched
finger, and to catch flies in a room.</p>

<p>Their eggs vary in length from .61 to .70 of an inch, and in breadth from
.49 to .52. They have a ground-color of a light green. Their dots and
blotches vary greatly in number, size, and manner of distribution. Their
colors are light purple, darker purplish-brown, and other shades of brown
and lilac.</p>

<p>Autumnal and winter birds are very much duller and more obscurely colored,

<p>A spring male (52,283) from Washington is remarkable in having the
adjoining series of feathers down the middle of the back with their inner
webs broadly edged with yellow. In this respect it differs from all others
that we have noticed.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Yellow-crowned Wood Warbler is one of the most common
species of this genus, as well as one of the most widely distributed. It is
found, at different seasons, throughout the eastern part of the continent, as
far west as the Great Plains, extending at the far north to the Pacific Ocean.
It has been found in Greenland, three specimens having been taken within
twenty years, and on the shores of the Arctic Ocean, and during the winter
in the West India Islands, Mexico, and Central America. Specimens from
Florida and Fort Steilacoom, Panama, Guatemala, and Jamaica, and from Fort
Rae, Anderson River, and the Yukon, in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution,
attest its wide distribution. In Jamaica, in the neighborhood of
<!--279.png--><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 228]</span>
Spanishtown, this species has been known to breed. In view of the fact that
this bird is regarded, with good reason, as one of our most northern species,
breeding to the very shores of the frozen seas, the occurrence seems erratic
and remarkable. Yet it is not without corresponding vagaries in other species,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cærulescens</i> breeding in Cuba and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tigrina</i> in <abbr title="Santo">St.</abbr> Domingo and
Jamaica.</p>

<p>Mr. Paine, of East Randolph, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, states that these Warblers arrive in his
vicinity about the first of May, and remain there nearly two weeks, and then
all pass north. They do not return on their southern flight until the last
of September, when they remain about three weeks. It is a very active, restless
bird, chirping continually and very sharply as it flies around in search
of insects, but has not, so far as he knows, any song.</p>

<p>In Southern Illinois, as Mr. Ridgway informs me, this bird is a common
winter sojourner, remaining late in spring with the migratory species. It is
very abundant throughout the winter in woods, orchards, and door-yards.</p>

<p>Mr. Salvin found this species frequenting the more open districts about
Duenas, Guatemala, apparently preferring scattered bushes to the denser underwood,
and was an abundant species there throughout the winter season.</p>

<p>It is but quite recently that we have known with certainty its place and
manner of breeding. Neither Wilson, Nuttall, nor Audubon appear to have
met with its nest, though the latter received one from Professor McCulloch
of Halifax.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1855, early in July, I obtained a nest of this species
in Parsboro’, Nova Scotia. It was built in a low bush, in the midst of a
small village, and contained six eggs. The parents were very shy, and it
was with great difficulty that one of them was secured for identification.
Though late in the season, incubation had but just commenced.</p>

<p>The nest was built on a horizontal branch, the smaller twigs of which were
so interlaced as to admit of its being built upon them, though their extremities
were interwoven into its rim. The nest was small for the bird, being
only two inches in depth and four and a half in diameter. The cavity
is one and a half inches deep and two and a half wide. Its base and external
portions consist of fine, light, dry stalks of wild grasses, and slender
twigs and roots. Of the last the firm, strong rim of the nest is exclusively
woven. Within, the nest is composed of soft, fine grasses, downy
feathers, and the fine hair of the smaller mammals.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon, who observed very closely the habits of these birds during a
winter in Florida, describes them as very social among themselves, skipping
along the piazza, balancing themselves in the air opposite the sides of the
house in search of spiders and insects, diving through the low bushes of the
garden after larvæ and worms, and at night roosting among the orange-trees.
In his visit to Maine he found them very abundant in early May.
The woods seemed alive with them, and wherever he landed, on his way to
Labrador, he found them in great numbers.

This Warbler is an expert flycatcher, feeds chiefly on insects, and is a great
devourer of small caterpillars; but in the winter its food is largely composed
of berries, especially those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myrica cerifera</i>. It will also feed on grass-seeds.
In the warmer wintry days in Florida, when insects are abundant,
Mr. Audubon states that these birds are particularly active in their pursuit,
and the trees seem full of them. At this time they emit, at each movement,
a single note, <i class="birdcall">twēēt</i>, so very peculiar that they may be at once recognized by
the cry.</p>

<p>Wilson states that these Warblers appear in Pennsylvania, from the North,
early in October, and stay there several weeks. Some of them remain in
the Southern States all winter. They feed with great avidity upon the berries
of the red cedar.</p>

<p>In Western Massachusetts it is a very abundant spring and autumn visitant,
making but a brief stay in spring, but passing northward in large numbers.
In autumn it remains longer, and passes south more leisurely. Mr.
B. P. Mann found its nest and eggs in Concord, but this was probably an exceptional
instance. In Eastern Maine it arrives May 25, and, as Mr. Boardman
thinks, remains to breed. Both Dr. Suckley and Dr. Cooper met with
this species in Washington Territory, where it is very rare.</p>

<p>No writers have observed or noted the song of this bird, except Mr. T. M.
Trippe (American <abbr title="Naturalist, Two, page">Nat., II. p.</abbr> 171), who states that during its spring migrations
it has a very sweet song or warble, uttered at short intervals.</p>

<p>It reaches the high northern latitudes late in May, and leaves that region
in September. The observations of Mr. McFarlane show that the nests of
this bird are moderately common at Anderson River, and are generally built
in low spruce-trees four or five feet from the ground. In one or two
instances it was placed on the ground.</p>

<p>The eggs of this Warbler vary from .72 to .80 of an inch in length, and
from .50 to .55 in breadth. Their ground-color is white, often tinged with a
bluish shade, and blotched and spotted with reddish-brown, purple, and darker
shades of brown. They are of a rounded oval shape.</p>

<p>This bird is very closely allied to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. coronata</i>, but is distinguished by the
yellow (not white) throat; the absence of a superciliary white stripe (the
eyelids white, however); the restriction of the black of the face to the lores,
and to a suffusion round the eye; and the presence of one broad band on the
wings, instead of two narrow ones.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This beautiful Warbler, so strikingly simulating the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. coronata</i>
in the character of its markings, and now so well known as a common species
on the Pacific coast, was first met with by Mr. Townsend near the Columbia
River, where he found it very abundant. His account of its habits is inconsistent,
and probably not reliable. Mr. Nuttall, who was with Mr. Townsend,
differs, also, essentially in his account. He states that he first saw them about
the middle of April, and that their song bore a very close resemblance to that
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. æstiva</i>, but was delivered in a much superior style. They remained
his summer companions, breeding among the shady firs on the borders of
prairie openings, where there was an abundant supply of insect food. By the
8th of June he found their young already out, in small and busy flocks, solicitously
attended by their parents. They greatly resembled the young of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coronata</i>. These birds frequented large trees, particularly the water-oaks,
and the lower branches of gigantic firs.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found this Warbler one of the most abundant species of Washington
Territory, and believed them to be, to some extent, a resident species,
as he met them about the Straits of Fuca in March. He speaks of its song
as lively, and heard everywhere on the borders of the woods, even near the
coast, where few of the smaller species ever visit. In the fall he noticed
straggling flocks of the young wandering about the low shrubbery in large
numbers. The same writer also states that this species is in winter a very
abundant bird in the southern part of California, flitting about among the
bushes and low trees. The males are then in the dull plumage of the females,
and do not put on their richer hues until March or April. He saw none
south of San Francisco after May 1, but they began to reappear in September.
As he found newly fledged young near Lake Tahoe, he thinks they breed
throughout the higher Sierra Nevada. At the sea level in latitude 37<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> they
appear late in September, and remain until March 20.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley regarded this bird as the most abundant species visiting the
<!--284.png--><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 231]</span>
western portion of Washington Territory. Near Fort Steilacoom it was
found principally among the oak-trees on the plains.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse found it abundant in New Mexico, confining itself to the
timbered and mountainous districts, and especially plentiful among the San
Francisco Mountains, feeding among the tall pines. Dr. Coues found it exceedingly
common in Arizona, where some spend the winter, and a few possibly
remain in the summer to breed.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann found them remaining in the Sacramento Valley throughout
the winter, and quotes Dr. Kennerly as finding these birds on the Boca
Grande and at different points in Sonora. Mr. Gambel found these Warblers
on all his route from New Mexico to California in great abundance, their
habits greatly resembling those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. coronata</i>. They display a great deal
of familiarity, entering the towns, resorting to the gardens and hedge-rows,
and even the corrals of the houses, descending also to the ground in company
with Blackbirds and Sparrows.</p>

<p>This Warbler is thus shown to have a very extended distribution. It is
now known to be found, at different seasons, from Central America to British
Columbia, and from New Mexico to the Pacific.</p>

<p>We are indebted to the late Mr. Hepburn for all the knowledge we possess
in reference to its nests, eggs, and breeding-habits. He procured their nests
and eggs in Vancouver’s Island. They were built in the forked branches of
small shrubs. Around these the materials of which they were built were
strongly bound, and to it the nests were thus securely fastened. They were
quite long and large for the bird, being four inches in height, and three and
a half in diameter. The cavity is small, but deep. The external periphery
of the nest is made of coarse strips of bark, long dry leaves of wild
grasses, and strong stalks of plants, intermingled with finer grasses, pieces of
cotton cloth, and other materials. The inner nest is also a singular combination
of various materials, yet carefully and elaborately put together. It is
made up of fine grasses, feathers, lichens, mosses, fine roots, etc., all felted together
and lined with a warm bedding of fur and feathers. Mr. Hepburn’s
observations, so far as they go, seem to show that this bird does not usually
build in such lofty positions as Nuttall and others conjectured.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Hepburn, they arrive in Vancouver’s Island in the middle
of April, and generally frequent high trees, constructing their nests in the
upper branches, though also frequently building in low bushes, a few feet
from the ground. The number of their eggs is four. These, he states, have
a pure white ground, and are spotted, usually chiefly about the larger end,
with red markings.</p>

<p>Mr. Salvin met with both this species and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. coronata</i> at San Geronimo,
November, 1859. They congregated together on the ground, where they
principally obtained their food.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper, in his paper on the fauna of Montana, mentions this Warbler
as the only one of the genus seen by him between Fort Benton and Fort
<!--285.png--><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 232]</span>
Vancouver. It was very common throughout the mountains, and he found it
in every portion of the country west of them, even where scarcely a bush
was to be seen.</p>

<p>According to the careful observations of Mr. Robert Ridgway, this Warbler,
during the summer months, in the Great Basin, chiefly inhabits the
pines of the high mountain ranges, as well as the cedar and piñon woods of
the desert mountains. In winter it descends to the lower portions, being
then found among the willows, or, in small roving companies, hopping among
the tree-tops in the river valleys. In manners it is said by him to resemble
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coronata</i>, but in their notes they differ very widely. A nest, containing
three young, was found by Mr. Ridgway near the extremity of a horizontal
branch of a pine-tree, about ten feet from the ground.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Audubon Warbler do not resemble those of any <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroica</i>
with which I am acquainted, but are most like those of the Hooded Warbler.
They measure .70 by .50 of an inch, have a reddish or pinkish white
ground, and are sparingly marked with fine brown markings, tinted with a
crimson shading.</p>

<p><!--286.png--><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 233]</span>
<span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Black and Yellow Warbler, one of the most beautiful of this
attractive family, was supposed by our earlier writers to be exceedingly rare.
Wilson never met with more than two specimens,&mdash;one in Ohio, the other
on the Mississippi,&mdash;and spoke of it as a very scarce species. In regard to
its song he was quite at fault, denying to it any notes deserving the name
of song. Nuttall, who had only seen it occasionally in Massachusetts, in
the middle of May, regarded it as rare, and was unacquainted with its
notes. Its history is now much better known, and neither its great rarity
nor its deficiency as to melody can any longer be admitted.</p>

<p>At certain seasons and in particular places it is a very common species.
It may be found during the breeding-season throughout North America east
of the Great Plains, between latitude 44<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> and Fort Simpson in the fur
country. During its migrations it may be met with in most of the Eastern
States, in Eastern Mexico, and the northern portions of South America. It
has been found in the Bahamas, and also in Cuba, where it is not common.
Specimens have been received from Mexico, Guatemala, and Panama, and
from Fort Resolution, Rupert House, and Fort Simpson, in Arctic America,
and as far to the west as the mouth of Vermilion River. Dr. Bryant
met with it in the Bahamas as early as the 15th of March, where it was
quite common. M. Boucard found it at Playa Vicente, in the hot portion
of the State of Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>

<p>In Western Massachusetts, Mr. Allen found it a common spring and
autumn visitor, occurring in its northern flights from the middle of May to
the first of June, and in the autumn as late as September 20. Professor
Verrill found it in Western Maine, but not common, both in spring and fall,
but had no reason to believe that it bred there. Mr. Boardman does not
include it in his list of Calais birds, and I did not find it among the islands
in the Bay of Fundy. In the vicinity of Halifax, during the months of
June and July, it is one of the most common of the Warblers, occurring in
every direction.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon observed these Warblers in Louisiana, in their migrations, as
early as the middle of March; but its appearance there, as well as in Kentucky
and Ohio, appeared to be occasional and accidental. In autumn he has met
with them in large numbers among the mountains of Northern Pennsylvania,
They were passing southward with their young. While on his way to Labrador
he noticed them in Maine, near Eastport, in May, very abundant along
the roads, the fields, and the low woods, as well as in the orchards and gardens.
The season was then not advanced, the weather cold; and these birds
sheltered themselves by night among the evergreens, and were often so chilled
as to be readily taken by the hand. He also met them wherever he landed
in the neighboring islands in the Bay of Fundy and at Labrador.</p>

<p>The song of this Warbler is clear and sweetly modulated, and surpasses
that of most of this family. It seems to prefer the interior of low woods,
where its notes may chiefly be heard during the early summer, as it sings
<!--287.png--><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 234]</span>
while it is searching for its food among the branches, in the manner of the
Vireos.</p>

<p>Like nearly all the members of this family, in its search for food it blends
the habits of the Creepers with those of the Flycatchers, feeding upon
insects in their every form, running up and down the trunks for the ova,
larvæ, and pupæ, expertly catching the insect on the wing, and equally
skilful in hovering over the expanded bud and searching the opening leaves.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon found its nest placed deep among the branches of low fir-trees,
supported by horizontal twigs, constructed of moss and lichens, and
lined with fibrous roots and feathers. One found in Labrador, in the beginning
of July, contained five eggs, small and rather more elongated than is
common in this genus. They were white, and sprinkled with reddish dots at
the larger end. The female fluttered among the branches, spreading her
wings and tail in great distress, and returning to her nest as soon as the intruders
were a few yards off. In August he saw a number of their young
already following their parents and moving southward. In his expedition
to Texas, Mr. Audubon again met this bird, in considerable numbers, early
in April. Their eggs, he states, measure three fourths of an inch in length
by nine sixteenths in breadth. In some the ground-color, instead of pure
white, is of a yellowish tinge.</p>

<p>The writer found this Warbler abundant near Halifax in the early summer
of 1850, frequenting the thick hemlock woods, confiding in its habits,
unsuspicious, and easily approached. The distress, as described by Audubon,
manifested in behalf of its own young, it is as ready to exhibit when the
nest of a feathered neighbor is disturbed. A pair of Hudson’s Bay Titmice,
protesting against the invasion of their home, by their outcries brought a pair
of these Warblers to their sympathetic assistance; and the latter manifested,
in a more gentle way, quite as much distress and anxiety as the real parents.
With expanded tail and half-extended wings they fluttered overhead among
the branches, approaching us almost within reach, uttering the most piteous
outcries.</p>

<p>Sir John Richardson found this Warbler as common and as familiar as
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. æstiva</i> on the Saskatchewan, and greatly resembling it in habits,
though gifted with a much more varied and agreeable song.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennicott met this Warbler on Great Slave Lake, June 12, 1860,
where he obtained a female, nest, and five eggs. The nest, loosely built, was
placed in a small spruce about two feet from the ground, and in thick
woods. The bird was rather bold, coming to her nest while he stood by it.
This nest was only one and a half inches deep, with a diameter of three and
a half inches; the cavity only one inch deep, with a diameter of two and a
half inches. It was made almost entirely of fine stems of plants and slender
grasses, and a few mosses. The cavity was lined with finer stems, and fine
black roots of herbaceous plants.</p>

<p>The eggs of this Warbler are, in shape, a rounded oval, one end being but
<!--288.png--><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 235]</span>
slightly more pointed than the other. They measure .62 of an inch in
length and .49 in breadth. Their ground-color is a light ashen hue, or a
dull white, and this is more or less sprinkled with fine dots and blotches
of a light brown. For the most part these are grouped in a ring about
the larger end.</p>

<p>Mr. R. Deane, of Cambridge, found this bird breeding near Lake Umbagog.
Its nest was in the fork of a low spruce about three feet from the
ground. The nest contained four eggs, and was made of dry grasses, spruce
twigs, and rootlets. It was lined with fine black roots, being a rather coarse
structure for a Warbler. The eggs were nearly spherical, averaging .62 by
.51 of an inch. Their ground-color was a creamy-white, sparsely marked
with a few large blotches of lilac and umber.</p>

whitish supra-auricular streak; while others from the same locality, and

a quite distinct white streak over the ear-coverts.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Of this somewhat rare Warbler very little is as yet well known.
Its habits and distribution during the breeding-season need more light than
we now possess to enable us to give its story with any degree of exactness.
Its appearance in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and Missouri early in May,
when Warblers that go north to breed are on their way, at first suggested its
belonging to that class. It is not known to proceed any farther north, except
in accidental instances; though the writer has been assured, and has no
reason to doubt the fact, that it abounds and breeds in the neighborhood
of Niagara Falls. I can find no good evidence that it ever occurs in Massachusetts.
Individuals have been obtained in northern South America, Panama,
and Cuba. Dr. Woodhouse describes it as quite common in Texas and
in the Indian Territory, where it breeds, as he obtained both the old and the
young birds. It was also abundant among the timbered lands of the Arkansas
and its tributaries. It was not obtained in any other of the government
expeditions, nor was it found in Arizona by Dr. Coues. Mr. T. M. Trippe
noticed a single individual near Orange, <abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr> Wilson supposed them to
breed in Pennsylvania, though he was never able to find their nests. He
usually met with these birds in marshes or on the borders of streams among
the branches of poplars. Their habits were those of the Flycatchers. He
saw none later than the 20th of August. Describing this species as the Blue-green
Warbler, as met with by him on the banks of the Cumberland early in
April, he mentions its gleaning for food among the upper branches of the
tallest trees, rendering it difficult to be procured. Its resemblance, in habits,
to Flycatchers, he again remarks. Its only note was a feeble <i class="birdcall">cheep</i>.</p>

<p>According to Audubon, this Warbler appears in Louisiana, where it also
breeds early in spring, and leaves the first of October. Like all its family, it
is quite lively, has a similar flight, moves sideways up and down the branches,
and hangs from the ends of the twigs in its search for insects.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon also states that the liveliness of the notes of this Warbler
renders it conspicuous in the forests, the skirts of which it frequents. Its
song, though neither loud nor of long continuance, he speaks of as extremely
sweet and mellow. He found it as numerous in the State of Louisiana as
any other Warbler, so that he could sometimes obtain five or six in a single
walk.</p>

<p>The nest he describes as placed in the forks of a low tree or bush, partly
pensile, projecting a little above the twigs to which it is attached, and extending
below them nearly two inches. The outer part is composed of the
fibres of vines and the stalks of herbaceous plants, with slender roots arranged
in a circular manner. The nest is lined with fine dry fibres of the
<!--290.png--><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 237]</span>
Spanish moss. The eggs are five in number, of a pure white with a few reddish
spots about the larger end. When disturbed during incubation, the
female is said to trail along the branches with drooping wings and plaintive
notes, in the manner of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. æstiva</i>. After the young have left the nest, they
move and hunt together, in company with their parents, evincing great activity
in the pursuit of insects. They are also said to have a great partiality
for trees the tops of which are thickly covered with grapevines, and to occasionally
alight on tall weeds, feeding upon their seeds.</p>

<p>In his visit to Texas, Mr. Audubon met a large number of these birds
apparently coming from Mexico. On one occasion he encountered a large
flock on a small island.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall mentions finding these birds very abundant in Tennessee and
also in West Florida.</p>

<p>In only a single instance has the writer met with this Warbler. This was
about the middle of June, at the Fairmount Water Works in the city of Philadelphia,
where, among the tops of the trees, a single individual was busily
engaged in hunting insects, undisturbed by the large numbers and vicinity
of visitors to the grounds. It kept in the tops of the trees, moving about
with great agility.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway gives the Cærulean Warbler as the most abundant species
of its genus in the Lower Wabash Valley, not only during the spring and
fall migrations, but also in the summer, when it breeds more plentifully even
than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. æstiva</i>. It inhabits, however, only the deep woods of the bottom
lands, where it is seldom seen, and only to be distinguished by the naturalist.
Inhabiting, mostly, the tree-tops, it is an inconspicuous bird, and
thus one that easily escapes notice. In its habits it is perhaps less interesting
than others of its genus, being so retired, and possessing only the most
feeble notes.</p>

Upper parts nearly uniform black, with a whitish scapular stripe and a large
white patch in the middle of the wing-coverts. An oblong patch in the middle of the
crown, and the entire side of the head and neck (including a superciliary stripe from the
nostrils), the chin, throat, and forepart of the breast, bright orange-red. A black stripe
from the commissure passing around the lower half of the eye, and including the ear-coverts;
with, however, an orange crescent in it, just below the eye, the extreme lid being black.
Rest of under parts white, strongly tinged with yellowish-orange on the breast and belly,
and streaked with black on the sides. Outer three tail-feathers white, the shafts and tips
dark brown; the fourth and fifth spotted much with white; the other tail-feathers and
quills almost black. <i class="sex">Female</i> similar; the colors duller; the feathers of the upper parts
with olivaceous edges. Length, 5.50; wing, 2.83; tail, 2.25.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern Province of United States; Eastern Mexico, and south to Bogota and
Ecuador; Bahamas alone of West Indies with certainty.</p>

<p>Autumnal males resemble the females. They have two white bands instead
of one; the black stripes on the sides are larger; under parts yellowish;
the throat yellowish, passing into purer yellow behind.</p>

<p>Autumnal young birds have the same pattern of coloration, but the dark
portions are dull grayish-umber, with the streaks very obsolete, and the light
parts dull buffy-white, tinged with yellow on the jugulum; there is neither
clear black, bright yellow, nor pure white on the plumage, except the latter
on the wing-bands and tail-patches.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This somewhat rare and very beautiful Warbler requires additional
investigation into its habits before its history can be regarded as satisfactorily
known. Save in reference to its wider distribution during its southern
migrations, little more is known as to its habits than where Audubon
left its history nearly thirty years since. The Smithsonian collection has
specimens from Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Missouri, Illinois, and from
Central America. Mr. Sclater has received specimens from Mexico, and from
Ecuador in South America. Other writers mention having specimens from
Guiana, Martinique, and Panama, and Dr. Bryant found it in the Bahamas.
It is thus known to have a wide distribution from the Atlantic to the Mississippi
River, as far to the north probably as Labrador. Its area of reproduction
is not known with exactness, but the southern limit is supposed to
be the high wooded districts of Pennsylvania, New York, and New England.
A young bird was taken by Holböll, October 16, 1845, at Frederikshaab,
Greenland. In 1837 an egg was sent me from Coventry, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, which purported
to belong to this bird; and in the following summer its nest and eggs
were procured in a wild, secluded part of Roxbury, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr> In neither case
was the identification entirely free from doubt.</p>

<p>Dr. Bachman states that when a resident of Lansingburg, <abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr>, in 1833,
he saw a pair of these birds in the act of constructing their nest. Mr. Allen
has no doubt that a few breed in the vicinity of Springfield, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, as he has
obtained them as late as June 24. He found it most common in mixed or
hard-wood forests. It arrives about the middle of May. Professor Verrill
gives it as a summer resident of Western Maine, though rarely seen on
<!--292.png--><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 239]</span>
account of its habit of keeping concealed among the dense foliage. Mr.
Boardman gives the same account of its residence in summer in the neighborhood
of Calais.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon did not regard this bird and his “Hemlock Warbler” as the
same species, but gave distinct and different accounts of their habits. We
have therefore to receive with caution these records of peculiarities. He
found the Blackburnian Warbler breeding in Northeastern Maine, in New
Brunswick, in the Magdaleine Islands, and in Labrador and Newfoundland.
He states, correctly, that it has a very sweet song of five or six notes, much
louder than seemed possible from the size of the bird. It pursues its
insect prey among the branches of the fir-trees, moving along after the manner
of the common Redstart.</p>

<p>Mr. McCulloch, of Halifax, gave Mr. Audubon a nest of this bird with
three eggs. The nest was formed externally of different textures, lined
with fine delicate strips of bark and a thick bed of feathers and horse-hair.
The eggs were small, conical, with a white ground spotted with light red
at the larger end. The nest was in the small fork of a tree five feet from
the ground, and near a brook.</p>

<p>The nest obtained in Roxbury was in a bush, a few feet from the ground,
in a very wild region of forest and rocks. Externally, except in its length,
which was less, it resembled a nest of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">G. trichas</i>, being made of coarse,
dry grasses. Internally it was much more warmly lined with feathers and
soft fur than is the case in nests of the Yellow-Throat. The eggs were of
a crystal whiteness, marked at their larger end with dark purple, and but
for their smaller size might have been mistaken for those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">G. trichas</i>.
The position of the nest, however, was conclusive in regard to this point.
The egg from Coventry was substantially similar, except that reddish-brown
dots were mingled with the purple markings, in the form of a wreath around
the larger end.</p>

<p>Wilson describes this Warbler as songless, but attributes to its counterpart,
the Hemlock Warbler, a very sweet song of a few low notes,&mdash;a very
different account from that given by Audubon of the song of the Blackburnian.</p>

<p>Mr. Paine states that this species is resident during the summer months in
Randolph, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr> It is, he says, a very close companion of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. virens</i>, arriving
at the same time with it even to a day, or about the 10th of May. Its
dry chirping song may then be heard in striking contrast with the sweet
notes of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">virens</i>. He was not able to find its nest.</p>

<p>Mr. C. W. Wyatt met with this species as a winter resident at Alto, in Colombia,
South America. Its upward range seemed to be terminated only by
the paramos. Among the oaks on the Pamplona road he found it very common
just under the paramo, the bright orange throat of the male making it
a very conspicuous bird. He was led to believe that they were not found
there at a lower elevation than five thousand feet.</p>

<p>In the Review (p. 209) several variations in this species are noted; but at
that time there was not a sufficient number of specimens to warrant our
coming to a conclusion as to their value. Now, however, we have better
material before us, and upon the examination of about thirty specimens, including
two series of nearly equal numbers,&mdash;one from the Atlantic States
and the West Indies, the other from the Mississippi region and Middle
America,&mdash;find that there are two appreciably different races, to be distinguished
from each other by points of constant difference. All birds of the
first series have the bill longer than any of the latter, the difference in a
majority of the specimens being very considerable; they also have the superciliary
stripe bright yellow anteriorly, while among the latter there is never
more than a trace of yellow over the lores, and even this minimum amount
is discernible only in one or two individuals. The West Indian form is, of
course, the true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominica</i>, and to be distinguished as <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominica</i>; as none
of the synonymes of this species were founded upon the Mexican one, however,
it will be necessary to propose a new name; accordingly, the term <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">albilora</i> is selected as being most descriptive of its peculiar features.</p>

<p>The following synopsis, taken from typical specimens, shows the differences
between these two races:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="indenthanging">(<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3,322, <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, Liberty County, Georgia.) Bill (from nostril), .45; tarsus, .60;

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The history of the Yellow-throated Warbler is very imperfectly
known. Its geographical distribution is irregular and apparently eccentric.
Found occasionally, rather than frequently, in the Southern Atlantic and Gulf
States, it occurs irregularly as far north as Washington, New York City,
Cleveland, <abbr title="Ohio">O.</abbr>, Union County, <abbr title="Illinois">Ill.</abbr>, and Kansas. In the last place it is supposed
also occasionally to breed. West of this it has not been traced in any
portion of the United States. It was obtained in Tamaulipas, Mexico, by
Lieutenant Couch, and on the western coast Mr. Xantus found it at Colima.
Mr. Sclater has also procured it from other portions of Mexico, and M. Boucard
<!--297.png--><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 242]</span>
took it at Oaxaca. It has been obtained in Guatemala and Jamaica. In
the latter place it is found the entire season. In Cuba, in the winter, it is
quite common. It has also been found in <abbr title="Santo">St.</abbr> Domingo, and probably in the
other West India Islands. Mr. Gosse states that these birds do not appear in
Jamaica before the 16th of August, and that they leave by the first of April.
On the other hand, Mr. March, in his notes on the birds of that island, states
that on the 8th of August he obtained an old bird and two young, the latter
of which he was confident had been hatched on the island, and his son had
met with the birds all through the summer, and had procured a specimen on
the 4th of June.</p>

<p>Wilson states that the habits of this species partake more of those of the
Creeper than of the true Warbler. He met with it in Georgia in the month
of February. He speaks of its notes as loud, and as resembling those of the
Indigo-Bird. It remained some time creeping around the branches of the
same pine, in the manner of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parus</i>, uttering its song every few minutes.
When it flew to another tree, it would alight on the trunk and run nimbly
up and down in search of insects. They are said to arrive in Georgia in
February, after an absence of only three months. Wilson states that they
occur as far north as Pennsylvania, but does not give his authority. The
food of this species appears to be larvæ and pupæ, rather than winged insects.
Those dissected by Mr. Gosse in Jamaica were found to have quite large
stomachs, containing caterpillars of various kinds.</p>

<p>Nuttall and Audubon are very contradictory in their statements touching
its nesting, and it is not probable that the accounts given by either are
founded upon any reliable authorities. The former describes a nest remarkable
both for structure and situation, said to have been found in West Florida,
suspended by a kind of rope from the end of branches over a stream
or a ravine. This nest, entirely pensile, is impervious to rain, and with an
entrance at the bottom. He gives a very full and minute description of this
nest, but gives no authority and no data to establish its authenticity. We
can therefore only dismiss it as probably erroneous.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mr. Audubon claims to have seen its nest, of which he
gives a very different account. He describes it as very prettily constructed,
like the nests of any other of this genus, its outer parts made of dry lichens
and soft mosses, the inner of silky substances and fibres of the Spanish moss.
The eggs are said to be four in number, with a white ground-color and a few
purple dots near the larger end. He thinks they raise two broods in a season
in Louisiana. These nests are not pensile, but are placed on the horizontal
branch of the cypress, from twenty to fifty feet above the ground. It
closely resembles a knot or a tuft of moss, and therefore is not easily discovered
from below.</p>

<p>A nest containing a single egg, found by Mr. Gosse near Neosho Falls, and
supposed to belong to this species, but not fully identified, was built in a low
sapling a few feet from the ground, and is a very neat structure, such as is
<!--298.png--><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 243]</span>
described by Audubon. The egg is pure crystal-white, oblong and pointed,
and marked with purple and brown.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway informs me that in Southern Illinois, at least in the valley
of the Lower Wabash, the Yellow-throated Warbler may be said to be at least
a regular, though not common, summer sojourner. Though it inhabits chiefly
the swampy portions of the bottom-lands, it makes frequent visits to the orchards
and door-yards, less often, however, in the breeding than in the migrating
season. In its manners it is almost as much of a Creeper as the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mniotilta varia</i>, being frequently seen creeping not only along the branches
of trees, but over the eaves and cornices of buildings, with all the facility
of a Nuthatch.</p>

<p>Eggs supposed to be of this species, taken near Wilmington, <abbr title="North Carolina">N. C.</abbr>, by
Mr. Norwood Giles (16,199, <abbr title="Smithsonian Collection">Smith. Coll.</abbr>), have a ground-color of dull ashy-white,
with a livid tinge. They are thickly speckled, chiefly around the
larger end, with irregular markings of rufous, and fainter ones of lilac interspersed
with a very few minute specks of black. They are broadly ovate
in form, and measure .70 by .55 of an inch.</p>

<i class="age">Adult male</i> (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 40,680, May 1, 1865, Dr. E. Coues). Whole upper parts,
including ear-coverts and sides of neck, ash-gray; small cuneate streaks over the crown,
coalesced laterally into a broad stripe on each side, with larger cuneate streaks on the interscapular
region, and inconspicuous linear streaks on upper tail-coverts, black. Two conspicuous
white bands across the wing, formed by the tips of middle and secondary coverts;
secondaries passing externally into light ash. Lateral tail-feather entirely white, except
about the basal third of the inner web (the dusky running some distance toward the end
along the edge), and a broad streak covering most of the terminal fourth of the outer web,
which are clear dusky; the next feather has the outer web exactly the same, but almost
the basal half of the inner is dusky; on the next the white is confined to an oblong spot (not
touching the inner edge) on about the terminal third, while the outer web is only edged
with white; the rest have no white at all. A superciliary stripe extending about .20 of
an inch behind the eye (that portion behind the eye white), the lower eyelid, maxillæ,
chin, throat, and jugulum pure gamboge-yellow. Rest of lower parts, including lining of
wing, pure white; the sides conspicuously streaked with black; lores, and a few obsolete
streaks along the junction of the ash and yellow, dusky. Wing, 2.60; tail, 2.20; bill (from
nostril), .30; tarsus, .60. <i class="age">Adult female</i> (40,685, May 24). Similar to the male, but colors
duller, and markings less sharply defined. Wing, 2.45; tail, 2.00. <i class="age">Young</i> (36,992, August

along the sides. Yellow superciliary stripe not well defined, and only a tinge of yellow
on the jugulum, the throat being grayish-white. Wings and tail nearly as in the adult.
The young in autumnal plumage is similar, but the yellow occupies its usual area; it is,
however, much duller, as well as lighter, than in the adult.</p>

This species is most closely related to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. adelaidæ</i>, from Porto Rico; but
in the latter the yellow beneath extends back to the crissum, covering even
the sides; there are also no streaks on the sides or back; the proportions,
too, are quite different, the wings and tail being scarcely three fourths as long,
while the bill and feet are much the same size, the tarsi even much shorter.
A specimen (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 41,808 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>) from Belize, Honduras, differs so essentially from
the Fort Whipple specimens, that it is, beyond doubt, entitled to a distinctive
name. The differences between these two very well marked races can
best be expressed in a table, as follows:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

behind the eye white; yellow of jugulum not spreading over breast (ending
1.35 from the bill). Streaks of crown coalesced into a broad stripe on each
side; those of back broad, and those on upper tail-coverts almost obsolete.

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> We are indebted to Dr. Elliott Coues for all that we at present
know in reference to this recently discovered species. He first met with it
July 2, 1864, in the Territory of Arizona. Dr. Coues first noticed this
bird among the pine woods covering the summit of Whipple’s Pass of the
Rocky Mountains. He saw no more in his journey into Central Arizona
until he was again among the pines at Port Whipple. There he again
found it, and it proved to be a very common bird. Dr. Coues anticipates
that this species will yet be found to occur in the forests of the San Francisco
Mountains, and that its range will be ascertained to include all the
pine tracts of New Mexico and Arizona, from the valley of the Rio Grande
to that of the Great Colorado River. He also has no doubt that it breeds
near and around Fort Whipple.</p>

<p>Specimens found at Belize, first believed to be identical with those from
Arizona, are now referred to a race called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decora</i>.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Coues’s observations, the Warbler arrives at Fort Whipple
about the 20th of April, and remains in that neighborhood until the third
week in September. It is found almost exclusively in pine woods, is active,
industrious, and noisy, and possesses very marked flycatching habits, flying
out from its perch to catch passing insects. It has been, so far, found almost
exclusively among the tallest trees.</p>

<p>In regard to the song of this species, Dr. Coues states that it appears to
have several different notes. One of these is the ordinary <i class="birdcall">tsip</i>, given out at
all times by both old and young of all kinds of small insectivorous birds.
<!--300.png--><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 245]</span>
Its true song, heard only in spring, consists of two or three loud sweet whistles,
sometimes slurred, followed by several continuous notes, resembling
<i class="birdcall">chir-r-r</i>, in a wiry but clear tone. Their notes are of great power for the
size of the bird. It also has another and quite different song, which Dr.
Coues thought greatly resembled the notes of the common American Redstart.</p>

<p>As all the birds he noticed had mated by the first of May, he has no doubt
that they raise two broods in a season; and the fact that he found newly
fledged young as late as the middle of August seems to corroborate the correctness
of his supposition. In regard to the eggs, nest, or breeding-habits
of this species, we have as yet no information.</p>

<i class="sex">Male.</i> Upper parts streaked with black and pale bluish-gray, which becomes
nearly white on the forepart of the back; the middle of the back glossed with greenish-yellow.
The crown is continuous yellow, bordered by a frontal and superciliary band, and
behind by a square spot of white. Loral region black, sending off a line over the eye, and
another below it. Ear-coverts and lower eyelid and entire under parts pure white, a purplish-chestnut
stripe starting on each side in a line with the black mustache, and extending
back to the thighs. Wing and tail-feathers dark brown, edged with bluish-gray,
except the secondaries and tertials, which are bordered with light yellowish-green. The
shoulders with two greenish-white bands. Three outer tail-feathers with white patches
near the end of the inner webs.</p>

<p class="small"><i class="sex">Female</i> like the male, except that the upper parts are yellowish-green, streaked with
black; the black mustache scarcely appreciable. Length, 5.00; wing, 2.50; tail, 2.20.</p>

<p>The young in autumn is very different from either male or female in
spring. The entire upper parts are of a continuous light olive-green; the
under parts white; the sides of the head, neck, and breast ash-gray, shading
insensibly into and tingeing the white of the chin and throat. No black
streaks are visible above or on the cheeks, and the eye is surrounded by a
continuous ring of white not seen in spring. In this plumage it has frequently
been considered as a distinct species.</p>

<p>The male in this plumage may usually be distinguished from the female
<!--301.png--><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 246]</span>
by possessing a trace, or a distinct stripe, of chestnut on the flanks, the
young female at least lacking it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The geographical distribution of this common species during its
season of reproduction is inferred rather than positively known. So far
as I am aware, it is not known to breed farther south than Massachusetts.
Yet it is probable that, when we know its history more exactly, it will be
found during the breeding-season in different suitable localities from Pennsylvania
to Canada. Mr. H. W. Parker, of Grinnell, Iowa, mentions this
bird as common in that neighborhood.</p>

<p>Until recently it was regarded as a rather rare species, and to a large extent
it had escaped the notice of our older ornithological writers. Wilson
could give but little account of its habits. It passed rapidly by him in its
spring migrations. He did not regard it as common, presumed that it has
no song, and nearly all that he says in regard to it is conjectural. Mr. Audubon
met with this species but once, and knew nothing as to its habits
or distribution. Mr. Nuttall, who observed it in Massachusetts, where it is
now known to be not uncommon in certain localities, also regarded it as very
rare. His account of it is somewhat hypothetical and inexact. Its song he
very accurately describes as similar to that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. æstiva</i>, only less of a
whistle and somewhat louder. He represents it as expressed by <i class="birdcall">tsh-tsh-tsh-tshyia</i>,
given at intervals of half a minute, and often answered by its mate
from her nest. Its lay is characterized as simple and lively. Late in June,
1831, he observed a pair collecting food for their young on the margin of the
Fresh Pond swamps in Cambridge.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen has found this species quite common in Western Massachusetts,
arriving there about the 9th of May, and remaining through the summer to
breed. He states&mdash;and his observations in this respect correspond with my
own&mdash;that during the breeding-season they frequent low woods and swampy
thickets, nesting in bushes, and adds that they are rarely found among high
trees. They leave there early in September.</p>

<p>Professor Verrill found this Warbler a common summer visitant in Western
Maine, arriving about the second week in May, and remaining there to
breed. Mr. Boardman thinks it reaches Eastern Maine about the middle
of May, and is a common summer resident. I did not meet this species
either in New Brunswick or Nova Scotia, nor was Dr. Bryant more fortunate,
but Lieutenant Bland gives it in his manuscript list of the birds
found in the neighborhood of Halifax.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway informs me that this species breeds in the oak openings and
among the prairie thickets of Southern Illinois.</p>

<p>During the eight months that are not included in their season of reproduction,
this species is scattered over a wide extent of territory. Their
earliest appearance in the Northern States (at Plattesmouth) is April 26, and
they all disappear early in September. At other times they have been met
with in the Bahamas, in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Panama. It has
<!--302.png--><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 247]</span>
not yet been detected in the West Indies. M. Boucard obtained specimens
at Playa Vicente, in the hot country of Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>

<p>In the neighborhood of Calais, Mr. Boardman informs me that this Warbler
is common, and that its habits resemble those of the Black-poll Warbler
more than those of any other of the genus. It always nests in bushes or in
low trees, and in the vicinity of swamps.</p>

<p>Among the memoranda furnished to the late Mr. Kennicott by Mr. Ross
is one to the effect that the Chestnut-sided Warbler was observed at Lake
of the Woods, May 29. How common it is at this point is not stated.</p>

<p>Mr. C. S. Paine regards the Chestnut-sided Warbler as one of the sweetest
singers that visit Vermont. He describes it as very confiding and gentle in
its habits. It is chiefly found inhabiting low bushes, in the neighborhood
of taller trees, and it always builds its nest in the fork of a low bush, not more
than from three to five feet from the ground. He has seen many of their
nests, and they have all been in similar situations. They will permit a very
near approach without leaving their nests. These are constructed about the
last of May. Their song continues until about the last of June. After this
they are seldom heard.</p>

<p>J. Elliot Cabot, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, had the good fortune to be the first of our naturalists
to discover in June, 1839, the nest and eggs of this Warbler. It was
fixed on the horizontal forked branch of an oak sapling, in Brookline, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>
The female remained sitting on her nest until so closely approached as to be
distinctly seen. The nest was of strips of red-cedar bark, and well lined
with coarse hair, and was compact, elastic, and shallow. It contained four
eggs, the ground-color of which was white, over which were distributed
numerous distinct spots of umber-brown. These were of different sizes,
more numerous towards the larger end.</p>

<p>In regard to their breeding in Pennsylvania, Mr. Nuttall mentions in the
second edition of his work that he met them among the Alleghanies at Farranville
in full song, and had no doubt that they were nesting there at the
time.</p>

<p>The Chestnut-sided Warbler usually constructs its nest in localities apart
from cultivated grounds, on the edges of low and swampy woods, but in places
more or less open. Quite a number of their nests have been met with by Mr.
George O. Welch, of Lynn, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr> Their more common situation has been
barberry-bushes. The nests vary from about two and a half to three and a
half inches in external height, and have a diameter of from three to four
inches. The cavity is about two inches deep. They are usually composed
externally of loosely intertwined strips of the bark of the smaller vegetables,
strengthened by a few stems and bits of dry grasses, and lined with woolly
vegetable fibres and a few soft hairs of the smaller animals. They are usually
very firmly bound to the smaller branches by silky fibres from the cocoons
of various insects. These nests were all found in open places, in low, wild
marshy localities, but none far from a cultivated neighborhood, and the
<!--303.png--><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 248]</span>
situations chosen for the nests do not differ materially from those usually
selected by the common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. æstiva</i>.</p>

<p>The eggs of this Warbler are of an oblong-oval shape, have a ground-color
of a rich creamy-white, and are beautifully spotted, chiefly about the larger
end, with two shades of purple and purplish-brown. They measure .65 by
.49 of an inch.</p>

Wing and tail-feathers brown, edged externally (except the inner tail-feathers) with dull
olive-green. Two conspicuous bars of white on the wing-coverts, the tertials edged with

to the sides of the neck, where it runs into a close patch of black streaks continued along
the breast and sides to the root of the tail. Outer two tail-feathers with an oblique patch
on the inner web near the end; the others edged internally with white. <i class="sex">Female</i> similar,
except that the upper parts are olivaceous, and, even on the crown, streaked with black;
the white on the sides and across the breast tinged with yellowish; a ring of the same
round the eye cut by a dusky line through it. Length of male, 5.75; wing, 3.00; tail, 2.25.</p>

Eastern Province of all North America to Arctic Ocean; Alaska; Greenland;
Cuba, in winter (rare); Bahamas; Bogota. Chile? Not recorded from intermediate
localities.</p>

<p>The autumnal dress of young birds is very different from that of spring.
The upper parts are light olive-green, obsoletely streaked with brown; beneath
greenish-yellow, obsoletely streaked on the breast and sides, the under
tail-coverts pure white, a yellowish ring round the eye, and a superciliary
one of the same color. In this dress it is scarcely possible to distinguish it
from the immature <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. castanea</i>. The differences, as far as tangible, will be
found detailed under the head of the latter species.</p>

<p>The young bird in its first dress is also quite different, again, from the
autumnal-plumaged birds. The upper parts are hoary-grayish, the lower
white; each feather of the whole body, except lower tail-coverts, with a terminal
bar or transverse spot of blackish, those on the upper parts approaching
<!--304.png--><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 249]</span>
the base of the feathers along the shaft. Wings and tail much as in the
autumnal plumage.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The appearance of this beautiful and familiar Warbler in New
England is the sure harbinger of the summer. The last of the migrants that
do not tarry, it brings up the rear of the hosts of hyperborean visitors. This
species ranges over the whole extent of eastern North America, from Mexico
to the Arctic seas. It has not been found farther west than the Great Plains
and the Rio Grande. Wherever found it is abundant, and its lively and
attractive manners and appearance render it a pleasing feature. It is not
known to stop to breed in Massachusetts, but it lingers with us till the last
blossom of the apple falls, and until the Bluebird and the Robin have already
well-fledged broods, sometimes as late as the 10th of June, and then suddenly
disappears.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse found it abundant in Texas and the Indian Territory, and
individuals have been procured in Missouri and Nebraska. It has been found
abundant in the Arctic regions, around Fort Anderson, Fort Yukon, and Fort
Good Hope. A single specimen was taken near Godhaab, Greenland, in
1853, as recorded by Professor Reinhardt. Dr. Bryant met with it in the
Bahamas, in the spring of 1859, where it was abundant from the 1st to the
10th of May. He describes its habits as similar to those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mniotilta
varia</i>, climbing around the trunks of trees in search of insects with the
same facility. Single specimens have been procured from Greenland on the
northeast, and from Bogota and Cuba. Dr. Coues found it abundant in
Labrador in all well-wooded situations, and describes it as a most expert flycatcher,
taking insects on the wing in the manner of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contopus virens</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen has never noted the arrival of this bird in Western Massachusetts
before the 20th of May, nor later than the 1st of June. They again become
abundant the last of September, and remain into October. In Eastern Maine
Mr. Boardman reports them abundant, and as remaining to breed. They are
there more numerous about open pastures than most Warblers. They nest
in low trees, about swampy places.</p>

<p>In Central Vermont, Mr. Paine states, the Black-Poll is the last of all the
migrant birds that come from the South, and is seen only a few days in the
first of June. It seldom stays more than a day or two, and then passes
north. It appears singular that a bird coming so late should go yet farther
north to breed. He states that its song consists only of a few low, lisping
peeps. It may usually be seen wandering over fields in which there are a
few scattered trees, and seems to be a very active, restless bird.</p>

<p>The writer also met with them in great abundance about Eastport, and in
the islands of the Grand Menan group. It was the most common Warbler
in that locality. The low swampy woods seemed filled with them, and were
vocal with their peculiar love-notes.</p>

<p>Wilson states that he occasionally found this Warbler in Pennsylvania and
New Jersey, and was confident they would be found to breed in those States,
<!--305.png--><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 250]</span>
but this has never been confirmed. He regarded it as a silent bird, and
Mr. Audubon does not compliment its vocal powers. Yet it is a pleasing
and varied, if not a powerful singer. Mr. Trippe speaks of its song as faint
and lisping, and as consisting of four or five syllables.</p>

<p>None of our birds, before its history was well known, has been made the
occasion for more ill-founded conjectures than the Black-Poll. Wilson was at
fault as to its song and its Southern breeding, and imagined it would be found
to nest in high tree-tops, so as not to be readily detected. Nuttall, on the
other hand, predicted that it would be found to breed on the ground, after the
manner of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mniotiltae</i>, or else in hollow trees. Mr. Audubon, finding its
nest in Labrador, indulges in flights of fancy over its supposed rarity, which,
seen in the light of our present knowledge, as an abundant bird in the locality
where his expedition was fitted out, are somewhat amusing. That nest
was in a thicket of low trees, contained four eggs, and was placed about four
feet from the ground, in the fork of a small branch, close to the main stem
of a fir-tree. Its internal diameter was two inches, and its depth one and
a half. It was formed, externally, of green and white moss and lichens, intermingled
with coarse dry grasses. It was lined, with great care, with fine,
dry, dark-colored mosses, resembling horse-hair, with a thick bed of soft
feathers of ducks and willow grouse.</p>

<p>In passing north, these Warblers, says Audubon, reach Louisiana early in
February, where they glean their food among the upper branches of the trees
overhanging the water. He never met with them in maritime parts of the
South, yet they are abundant in the State of New Jersey near the sea-shore.
As they pass northward their habits seem to undergo a change, and to partake
more of the nature of Creepers. They move along the trunks and lower
limbs, searching in their chinks for larvæ and pupæ. Later in the season, in
more northern localities, we again find them expert flycatchers, darting after
insects in all directions, chasing them while on the wing, and making the
clicking sound of the true Flycatcher.</p>

<p>They usually reach Massachusetts after the middle of May, and their stay
varies from one, usually, to nearly four weeks, especially when their insect-food
is abundant. In our orchards they feed eagerly upon the canker-worm,
which is just appearing as they pass through.</p>

<p>Around Eastport and at Grand Menan they confine themselves to the thick
swampy groves of evergreens, where they breed on the edges of the woods.
All of the several nests I met with in these localities were built in thick
spruce-trees, about eight feet from the ground, and in the midst of foliage so
dense as hardly to be noticeable. Yet the nests were large and bulky for so
small a bird, being nearly five inches in diameter and three in height. The
cavity is, however, small, being only two inches in diameter, and one and a
fourth to one and a half in depth. They were constructed chiefly of a
collection of slender young ends of branches of pines, firs, and spruce,
interwoven with and tied together by long branches of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cladonia</i> lichens,
<!--306.png--><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 251]</span>
slender herbaceous roots, and finer sedges. The nests were strongly built,
compact and homogeneous, and were elaborately lined with fine panicles of
grasses and fine straw. In all the nests found, the number of eggs was five.</p>

<p>It is a somewhat noticeable fact, that though this species is seen in New
England only by the middle of May, others of its kind have long before
reached high Arctic localities. Richardson records its presence at the Cumberland
House in May, and Engineer Cantonment by the 26th of April. Mr.
Lockhart procured a nest and five eggs at Fort Yukon, June 9. All the nests
taken in these localities were of smaller size, were built within two feet
of the ground, and all were much more warmly lined than were those from
Grand Menan. In a few instances Mr. McFarlane found the nests of this
species actually built upon the ground. This, however, is an abnormal position,
and only occasioned by the want of suitable situations in protected localities.
In one instance a nest was taken on the first of June, containing
well-developed embryos. Yet this same species has frequently been observed
lingering in Massachusetts a week or more after others of its species have
already built their nests and begun hatching.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species measure .72 by .50 of an inch. Their shape is an
oblong-oval. Their ground-color is a beautiful white, with a slight tinge of
pink, when fresh. They are blotched and dotted over the entire surface
with profuse markings of a subdued lavender, and deeper markings of a dark
purple intermixed with lighter spots of reddish-brown. The usual number
is five, though six are occasionally found in a nest.</p>

<p>The female and immature males of this species differ much from the

of the two species shows that in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castanea</i> the under parts are seldom washed
uniformly on the throat and breast with yellowish-green, but while this
may be seen on the sides of the neck and breast, or even across the latter,
the chin and throat are nearly white, the sides tinged with dirty brown,
even if the (generally present) trace of chestnut be wanting on the sides.
There is a buff tinge to the under tail-coverts; the quills are abruptly margined
with white, and there are no traces (however obsolete) of streaks on
the breast. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. striata</i> the under parts are quite uniformly washed with
greenish-yellow nearly as far back as the vent, the sides of the breast and
sometimes of the belly with obsolete streaks; no trace of the uniform dirty
reddish-brown on the sides; the under tail-coverts are pure white. The
quills are only gradually paler towards the inner edge, instead of being
rather abruptly white.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Bay-breasted Warbler is one of the many species belonging
to this genus whose history is yet very imperfectly known. Everywhere
quite rare, it is yet distributed from the Atlantic to the Great Plains, and
from the Gulf of Mexico far into the Hudson Bay Territory. In the winter
it is known to extend its migrations as far to the south as the northern portions
of South America. It has not been traced to Mexico nor to the West
India Islands, but has been procured by Mr. Salvin in Guatemala. Nearly
all the specimens obtained in the United States have either been taken
before the 12th of May or in the autumn, indicative of a more northern
breeding-place. In Eastern Massachusetts it is exceedingly rare, passing
through after the middle of May and returning in September. Mr. Maynard
has obtained a specimen as late as June 19, which, though not necessarily
proving that any breed there, indicates that the line of their area of
reproduction cannot be distant. In the western part of the same State, Mr.
Allen has found it from May 20 to the 25th, and has obtained one specimen
in July. In Western Maine, Mr. Verrill has noted its occurrence from the
middle of May to June, but it is very rare; and Mr. Boardman reports the
same for Eastern Maine, where it is a summer resident. He writes that he
has several times shot specimens in the early summer, but that he could
never find the nest. It is also given by Lieutenant Bland as one of the birds
found in the vicinity of Halifax. It was not observed by any of the governmental
exploring expeditions, nor found in Arizona by Dr. Coues. Mr.
Lawrence has received specimens from Panama, obtained in winter, Mr.
Cassin from Darien, and Mr. Sclater from Guatemala.</p>

<p>This species so far eluded the notice of Mr. Audubon as to prevent him
from giving any account of its habits. He only mentions its occasional
<!--308.png--><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 253]</span>
arrival in Pennsylvania and New Jersey early in April, and its almost
immediate and sudden disappearance. He several times obtained them at
that period, and yet has also shot them in Louisiana as late as June, while
busily searching for food among the blossoms of the cotton-plant.</p>

<p>Wilson also regarded this species as very rare. He reports it as passing
through Pennsylvania about the middle of May, but soon disappearing. He
describes these birds as having many of the habits of Titmice, and displaying
all their activity. It hangs about the extremity of the twigs, and
darts about from place to place with restless diligence in search of various
kinds of larvæ. Wilson never met with it in the summer, and very rarely
in the fall.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall noticed this species passing through Massachusetts about the
15th of April. He regarded it as an active insect-hunter, keeping in the tops
of the highest trees, darting about with great activity, and hanging from the
twigs with fluttering wings. One of these birds that had been wounded
soon became reconciled to its confinement, and greedily caught at and
devoured the flies that were offered. In its habits and manners it seemed
to him to greatly resemble the Chestnut-sided Warbler.</p>

<p>Mr. T. M. Trippe speaks of this Warbler as one of the last to arrive near
Orange, <abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr> Owing to the fact that at that time the foliage is pretty dense,
and that it makes but a short stay, it is not often seen. He speaks of it as
not quite so active as the other Warblers, keeping more on the lower boughs,
and seldom ascending to the tops of the trees.</p>

<p>Mr. C. W. Wyatt met with this species at Naranjo, in Colombia, South
America.</p>

<p>Eggs of this bird obtained by Mr. George Bush at Coldwater, near
Lake Superior, are of an oblong-oval shape, measuring .75 by .52 of an inch,
and except in their superior size and fewer markings might be mistaken for
eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. æstiva</i>. Their ground-color is a bluish or greenish white. The
markings are very few and fine, except those in the crown around the larger
end, and there the blotches are deeper and more numerous. Their colors are
dark reddish-brown and purple.</p>

<p>Mr. Maynard found this species the most abundant of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvicolidæ</i> at
Lake Umbagog, where it breeds. Two nests were taken in June. One was
found June 3, in a tree by the side of a cart-path in the woods, just completed.
It was built in the horizontal branch of a hemlock, twenty feet
from the ground, and five or six from the trunk of the tree. By the 8th of
June it contained three fresh eggs. The other was built in a similar situation,
fifteen feet from the ground, and contained two fresh eggs.</p>

<p>These nests were large for the bird, and resembled those of the Purple
Finch. They were composed outwardly of fine twigs of the hackmatack,
with which was mingled some of the long hanging <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Usnea</i> mosses. They were
very smoothly and neatly lined with black fibrous roots, the seed-stalks of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cladonia</i> mosses, and a few hairs. They had a diameter of about six inches,
<!--309.png--><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 254]</span>
and a height of about two and a half inches. The cavity was three inches
wide and an inch and a quarter deep. The eggs varied in length from .71
to .65 of an inch, and in breadth from .53 to .50. Their ground-color
was a bluish-green, thickly spotted with brown, and generally with a ring
of confluent blotches of brown and lilac around the larger end. Occasionally
the spots proved to be more or less of an umber-brown, and in some
specimens the spots were less numerous than in others.</p>

<p>These birds were found in all the wooded sections of that region, where
they frequented the tops of tall trees. Their song, he states, in its opening, is
like that of the Black-Poll, with a terminal warble similar to that of the
Redstart, but given with less energy.</p>

throat, lustrous black; this color extending in a broad lateral stripe to the tail. Rest of
under parts, including the axillary region, white. Wings and tail black above, the former
with a conspicuous white patch formed by the bases of all the primaries (except the first);
the inner webs of the secondaries and tertials with similar patches towards the base and
along the inner margin. All the tail-feathers, except the innermost, with a white patch on
the inner web near the end. Length, 5.50; wing, 2.60; tail, 2.25.</p>

<p class="small"><i class="sex">Female</i>, olive-green above and dull yellow beneath. Sides of head dusky olive, the eyelids
and a superciliary stripe whitish. Traces of the white patches at the base of the primaries
and of the tail.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern Province of United States; Jamaica, Cuba, and <abbr title="Santo">St.</abbr> Domingo in winter;
very abundant; Bahamas (<span class="sc">Bryant</span>). Not recorded from Mexico or Central America.</p>

<p>The white patch at the base of the primary, together with the total absence
of outer markings on the wings, is peculiar to this species, and is found
in both sexes. The female is more different from the male than that of any
other species.</p>

<p>The plumage of the male in autumn is similar to the spring dress, but
the back and wings are washed with greenish, and the black of the
throat variegated with white edges to the feathers. A younger male (788,
<!--310.png--><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 255]</span>
October 10, Carlisle, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>) differs in having the black appearing in patches,
the throat being mostly white; there is also a narrow white superciliary
stripe.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Black-throated Blue Warbler, at different seasons of the
year, is distributed over nearly the whole eastern portion of North America.
Abundant in the West Indies in winter, as also in the South Atlantic States
in early spring and late in fall, it is found during the breeding-season from
Northern New York and New England nearly to the Arctic regions. A few
probably stop to breed in the high portions of Massachusetts, and in late
seasons they linger about the orchards until June. They undoubtedly breed
in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse states that he found it abundant in Texas; but this is the
only instance, so far as is known, of its occurring west of the Mississippi
Valley.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the remarkably mild winter of 1866, a pair of these
birds were observed for several days in a sheltered portion of Boston. They
were in excellent condition, and were very busily employed hunting for the
larvæ and eggs of insects and spiders in the corners and crevices of the walls
of houses and out-buildings, evidently obtaining a full supply. In Southern
Illinois, Mr. Ridgway cites this Warbler as one of the least common of the
spring and fall visitants.</p>

<p>Audubon found this species in nearly every Southern and Southwestern
State during their migrations. They arrive in South Carolina late in March,
are most abundant in April, and leave early in May. They keep in the deep
woods, passing among the branches about twenty feet from the ground. He
traced them as far north as the Magdaleine Islands, but found none in Newfoundland,
and but a single specimen in Labrador. They breed in Nova
Scotia, and a nest was given him found near Halifax by Dr. MacCulloch.
These were said to be usually placed on the horizontal branch of a fir-tree,
seven or eight feet from the ground, and to be composed of fine strips of bark,
mosses, and fibrous roots, and lined with fine grasses and a warm bed of
feathers. The eggs, five in number, were white, with a rosy tint, and sprinkled
with reddish-brown dots, chiefly at the larger end.</p>

<p>This Warbler is an expert catcher of the smaller winged insects, pursuing
them quite a distance, and, when seizing them, making the clicking sound of
the true Flycatcher. So far as they have been observed, they have no song,
only a monotonous and sad-sounding <i class="birdcall">cheep</i>.</p>

<p>Nuttall, in the second edition of his Manual, mentions having observed
several pairs near Farranville, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>, on the Susquehanna, and among the
Alleghanies. It was in May, and in a thick and shady wood of hemlock.
They were busy foraging for food, and were uttering what he describes as
slender, wiry notes.</p>

<p>In Western Massachusetts, Mr. Allen states it to be common from the 15th
to the 25th of May, and again in September. They were found by Mr. C. W.
<!--311.png--><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 256]</span>
Bennett on Mount Holyoke during the breeding-season, and by Mr. B. Hosford
on the western ridges during the same period. They are common, Mr.
Boardman states, in the thick woods about Calais, through all the breeding-season.</p>

<p>In Jamaica, during the winter, it exclusively frequents the edges of tall
woods in unfrequented mountainous localities. They are found in that island
from October 7 until the 9th of April. Mr. Gosse, who has closely observed
their habits during winter, speaks of their playing together with much spirit
for half an hour at a time, chasing each other swiftly round and round, occasionally
dodging through the bushes, and uttering at intervals a pebbly <i class="birdcall">cheep</i>.
They never remain long alighted, and are difficult to kill. Restlessness is
their great characteristic. They often alight transversely on the long pendent
vines or slender trees, hopping up and down without a moment’s intermission,
pecking at insects. They are usually very plump and fat.</p>

<p>De la Sagra states that this bird occasionally breeds in Cuba, young birds
having been killed that had evidently been hatched there. The record of
this Warbler, as presented by different authors, is apparently inconsistent and
contradictory: rare with some observers, abundant with others; remaining
in Jamaica until well into April, yet common in South Carolina in March,
and even appearing in Massachusetts in midwinter; supposed to breed in
the highlands of Cuba, yet, except in the case of the nest taken near Halifax,
its manner of breeding was unknown until lately. It is probably rare in lowlands
everywhere, and nowhere common except among mountains, and, while
able to endure an inclement season where food is abundant, is influenced in
its migratory movements by instinctive promptings to change its quarters
entirely in reference to a supply of food, and not by the temperature merely.
Its presence in Boston in winter was of course a singular accident; but its
plump condition, and its contented stay so long as its supply of food was
abundant, sufficiently attested its ability to endure severe weather for at least
a limited period, and while its food was not wanting. Mr. Trippe states that
these birds reach Northern New Jersey during the first week of May, and
stay a whole month, remaining there longer than any other species. At first
they have no note but a simple chirp; but, before they leave, the males are
said to have a singular drawling song of four or five notes.</p>

<p>Mr. Paine states that this Warbler is a resident, but not very common bird,
in Randolph, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr> He has usually noticed it in the midst of thick woods,
not generally in tall trees, but among the lower branches or in bushes. The
song he describes as very short and insignificant, its tones sharp and wiry,
and not to be heard at any great distance. He knows nothing as to its nest.
They arrive at Randolph from the South about the middle of May.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Mr. John Burroughs for all the knowledge we possess
in relation to the nest and eggs of this species, which had previously baffled
the search of other naturalists. He was so fortunate as to meet with
their nest in the summer of 1871. Early in July, in company with his
<!--312.png--><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 257]</span>
nephew, Mr. C. B. Deyoe, Mr. Burroughs visited the same woods, in Roxbury,
Delaware County, <abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr>, in which he had in a previous year found the nest
of the Mourning Ground Warbler. The trees were mostly hemlock, with an
undergrowth of birch and beech. They first noticed the parent birds with
food in their bills, and then set about deliberately to find their nest by
watching their movements. But the birds were equally vigilant, and watched
them quite as determinedly. “It was diamond cut diamond.” They were so
suspicious, that, after loading their beaks with food, they would swallow it
themselves, rather than run the risk of betraying their secret by approaching
the nest. They even apparently attempted to mislead them by being very private
and confidential at a point some distance from the nest. The two watched
the birds for over an hour, when the mosquitoes made it too hot for them to
hold out any longer, and they made a rush upon the ground, determined to
hunt it over inch by inch. The birds then manifested the greatest consternation,
and when, on leaping over an old log, the young sprang out with a
scream, but a few feet from them, the distracted pair fairly threw themselves
under their very feet. The male bird trailed his bright new plumage in
the dust; and his much more humbly clad mate was, if anything, more solicitous
and venturesome, coming within easy reach. The nest was placed
in the fork of a small hemlock, about fifteen inches from the ground. There
were four, and perhaps five, young in the nest, and one egg unhatched, which,
on blowing, proved to have been fresh.</p>

<p>The nest measures three and a half inches in diameter, and a trifle more
than two in height. The cavity is broad and deep, two and a third inches in
diameter at the rim, and one and a half deep. Its base and periphery are
loose aggregations of strips of decayed inner bark from dead deciduous trees,
chiefly basswood, strengthened by fine twigs, rootlets, and bits of wood and
bark. Within this is a firm, compact, well-woven nest, made by an elaborate
interweaving of slender roots and twigs, hair, fine pine-needles, and similar
materials.</p>

<p>The egg is oval in shape, less obtuse, but not pointed, at one end, with a
grayish-white ground, pinkish when unblown, and marked around the larger
end with a wreath, chiefly of a bright umber-brown with lighter markings of
reddish-brown and obscure purple.  A few smaller dottings of the same are
sparingly distributed over the rest of the egg. Its measurements are .70 by
.50 of an inch. It more nearly resembles the eggs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. maculosa</i> than
any other, is about five per cent larger, a little more oblong, and the spots
differ in their reddish and purplish tinge, so far as one specimen may be
taken as a criterion.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Western and Middle Provinces of United States. Migratory southward into
Western Mexico (Oaxaca); Orizaba (winter, <span class="sc">Sumichrast</span>).</p>

<p>Female (53,373, East Humboldt Mountains, <abbr title="Nevada">Nev.</abbr>, July 14). Similar to
the male, but crown ash medially streaked with black, instead of continuous
black; the streaks on back narrow and inconspicuous; the black of the
throat confined to the jugulum, appearing in spots only on anterior half. A
young female (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 53,376, East Humboldt Mountains, August 10) is plain
brownish-ash above, lacking entirely the streaks on the back, and those on
sides of crown extremely obsolete. There is no black whatever on throat or
jugulum, which, with the well-defined supra-loral stripe and lower parts in
general, are soiled white, more brownish laterally. The other features, including
the yellow spot over the lores, with the wing and tail markings, are much as
in the adult. A young male (53,375), same locality and date, differs from the
last in having the sides of the crown black, and the throat-patch almost
complete, but much hidden by the broad white borders to the feathers. An
adult autumnal male (7,690, Calaveras River) is like the spring adult, but
the ash is overspread by brownish, nearly obliterating the dorsal streaks, and
dividing the black of the crown; the black throat-patch is perfectly defined,
but much obscured by white borders to the feathers.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Black-throated Gray or Dusky Warbler, so far as is now
known, belongs to the Western and Middle Provinces, occurring certainly
as far to the south as San Diego, in California, and as far to the north as Fort
Steilacoom, in Washington Territory, penetrating in winter into Mexico.
The most easterly localities in which it has been met with are in Arizona
and New Mexico. The Smithsonian Institution has received specimens also
from Columbia River, Calaveras, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, and Fort Defiance.</p>

<p>This species was first obtained and described by Mr. Townsend, who found
it abundant in the forests of the Columbia, where it breeds and remains
until nearly winter. Its nest, which he there met with, resembles that of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parula americana</i>, only it is made of the long and fibrous green moss, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Usnea</i>, peculiar to that region, and is placed among the upper branches of
oak-trees, suspended between two small twigs.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall states that it arrives on the Columbia early in May, and from
the manner in which its song was delivered at intervals, in the tops of deciduous
trees, he had no doubt that they were breeding in those forests as early
as May 23. This song he describes as delicate, but monotonous, uttered as
it busily and intently searches every leafy bough and expanding bud for
insects and their larvæ in the spreading oak, in which it utters its solitary
notes. Its song is repeated at short and regular intervals, and is said by Mr.
Nuttall to bear some resemblance to <i class="birdcall">t-shee-tshāy-tshaitshee</i>, varying the feeble
sound very little, and with the concluding note somewhat slenderly and
plaintively raised. Dr. Suckley speaks of this bird as moderately abundant
<!--315.png--><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 260]</span>
near Fort Steilacoom, generally met with on oaks, and very much resembling
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroica auduboni</i> in its habits. Its arrival there he gives as occurring
in the first week in April, or a month earlier than stated by Nuttall.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper met with a pair at Puget Sound that appeared to have a nest,
though he sought for it in vain. He describes its note as faint and unvaried.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues met with this Warbler in the vicinity of Fort Whipple, Arizona.
He speaks of it as common there as a spring and autumn migrant. He thinks
that a few remain to breed. It arrives in that Territory about April 20, and
is found until late in September. It is most common among the pine-trees,
and in its general habits is stated to resemble the new species <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. graciæ</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann found a few birds of this species near Sacramento, and also
on the range of mountains dividing the Calaveras and the Mokelumne Rivers.
During the survey by Lieutenant Williamson’s party, Dr. Heermann met
with a single specimen among the mountains, near the summit of the Tejon
Pass. It was in company with other small birds, migrating southward, and
gleaning its food from among the topmost branches of the tallest oaks. He
states that its notes closely resemble the sounds of the locust.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper states that these birds appear at San Diego by the 20th of
April, in small flocks migrating northward, and then uttering only a faint
chirp. They frequent low bushes along the coast, but as they proceed farther
north they take to the deciduous oaks as the leaves begin to expand, early
in May, at which time they reach the Columbia River. He has never met
with any in California after April.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway observed this species only in the pine and cedar woods of
the East Humboldt Mountains, where, in all probability, they were breeding.
He observed numerous families of young birds following their parents in
the months of July and August. He met with them only among the cedars
and the woods of the nut-pine, and never among the brushwood of the cañons
and ravines. He states that the common note of this bird greatly resembles
the sharp chirp of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroica coronata</i>, and is louder and more distinct
than that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. auduboni</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Boucard obtained specimens of these birds at Oaxaca, Mexico,
during the winter months.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span>&mdash;The Black-throated Green Warbler, like nearly all the members
of this highly interesting genus, has, to a very great degree, escaped the
closer observations of our older ornithologists. Wilson only noticed it as it
passed through Pennsylvania in its early spring migrations. He mentions its
frequenting the higher branches of forest trees in search of the larvæ of the
smaller insects that feed upon the opening buds, and describes it as a lively,
active bird, having only a few chirping notes. All had passed on by the
12th of May. Their return he was never able to notice, and he became
afterwards satisfied that a few remained all the summer in the higher grounds
of that State, having obtained several in June, 1809.</p>

<p>Audubon met with this bird from Newfoundland to Texas, but never found
<!--318.png--><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 263]</span>
it breeding. Nowhere abundant, there were large tracts of country where
he never met with it, or where it was of rare occurrence. He found it most
abundant in the vicinity of Eastport, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr> He also met with it during
summer, in New England generally, Northern Pennsylvania, and New York,
but not in Labrador. He describes its habits as a mingling of those of the
Warblers and of the Vireo, and its notes as resembling those of the latter.
In its search for food he found it quite regardless of the near presence of man.
In its spring migrations it passes through the woods usually in pairs, in the
fall reappearing in flocks of six or seven. In breeding it occurs only in
single pairs, and each pair appropriates to itself a large tract of territory
within which no other is usually found. After October, all have passed beyond
the limits of the United States.</p>

<p>During the winter months it appears to be quite common in different parts
of Mexico and Central America. In the large collection of Guatemalan skins
collected by Dr. Van Patten, and purchased by the Boston Natural History
Society, this bird was one of the most abundant of the migratory species.
Specimens were taken by Mr. Boucard at Playa Vicente, in the hot country
of Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse found this Warbler common in the Indian Territory and
in Texas, and Lieutenant Couch met with it in Tamaulipas, Mexico, in March,
1853. With these exceptions it has not been observed in any of the government
surveys, or found west of the valley of the Rio Grande. Besides the
points named, it has been obtained in Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, and in the West
Indies, in Central and in the northern portions of South America. Reinhardt
gives it as accidental in Greenland. A single stray specimen was obtained
in Heligoland, Europe, October 19, 1858.</p>

<p>Mr. Paine, of Randolph, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, notes the arrival of this bird about the 10th
of May. He speaks of it as a very sweet singer, and as usually seen in the
tops of tall trees, the hemlock being its favorite resort. There it chants its
sweet sad notes through even the heat of the day. It continues in song
nearly throughout the summer. Later in the season it frequents the open
fields, in which it is seldom seen in the breeding-season. Its food, which
it catches on the wing in the manner of Vireos, consists of the smaller
winged insects, caterpillars, and other larvæ. In the fall, according to Mr.
Audubon, it feeds upon various kinds of small berries.</p>

<p>It reaches Massachusetts the first of May, and is most numerous about
the 15th, when the larger proportion pass farther north. In Western
Maine, Professor Verrill states it to be a summer but not a common visitant;
and near Calais, Mr. Boardman has found it breeding, but does not regard it
as at all common, though in the year 1867 he found it quite abundant
in the thick woods in that neighborhood during its breeding-season. Dr.
Bryant also speaks of it as one of the most common of the Warblers observed
by him near Yarmouth, <abbr title="Nova Scotia">N. S.</abbr> A single specimen was taken at Julianhaab,
Greenland, in 1853, and sent to the Royal Museum of Copenhagen.</p>

<p><!--319.png--><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 264]</span>
In the vicinity of Boston, especially in the high grounds of Norfolk and
Essex Counties, it is a not uncommon species, and its nests are found in certain
favorite localities. Nuttall regards May 12 as the average of their first
appearance. Busy, quiet, and unsuspicious of man, they were seen by him,
collecting, in early October, in small groups, and moving restlessly through
the forests preparatory to departing south. June 8, 1830, he found a nest
of this species in a solitary situation among the Blue Hills of Milton, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>
The nest was in a low and stunted juniper (a very unusual location). As
he approached, the female remained motionless on the edge of the nest, in
such a manner as to be mistaken for a young bird. She then darted to the
ground, and, moving away expertly, disappeared. The nest contained four
eggs, which he describes as white inclining to flesh-color, variegated at the
larger end with pale purplish points interspersed with brown and black. The
nest was formed of fine strips of the inner bark of the juniper, and tough white
fibrous bark of other plants, lined with soft feathers and the slender tops of
grass. The male bird was singing his simple chant, resembling the syllables
<i class="birdcall">tē-dē-teritsé-a</i>, pronounced loud and slow, at the distance of a quarter of a mile
from the nest. He describes his song as simple, drawling, and plaintive. He
was constantly interrupting his song to catch small flies, keeping up a perpetual
snapping of his bill.</p>

<p>Several nests of this bird, given me by Mr. George O. Welch of Lynn, have
been found by him in high trees in thick woods on the western borders of
that city. They are all small, snug, compact structures, built on a base of
fine strips of bark, bits of leaves, and stems of plants. The upper rims are
a circular intertwining of fine slender twigs, interwoven with a few fine
stems of the most delicate grasses. The inner portions of these nests are
very softly and warmly bedded with the fine down and silky stems of
plants. They have a diameter of three and a quarter inches, and a height of
one and a half. The cavity is two inches in diameter, and one and a half
in depth. The eggs measure .70 by .50 of an inch, have a white or purplish-white
ground, and are blotched and dotted with markings of reddish and
purplish brown, diffused over the entire egg, but more numerous about the
larger end. One end is much more pointed than the other.</p>

<p>The autumnal adult male is much like the spring female, but the black

autumn is similar in general appearance, but there are no streaks above, except
on the crown, where they are mostly concealed; the stripe on side of head
is olivaceous, instead of black; and nearly all the black on the throat is concealed.</p>

<p>A fine adult male of this species was taken near Philadelphia, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>, in
the spring of 1868, and is now in the collection of the late W. P. Turnbull,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, of that city.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> In regard to the habits of this very rare Western Warbler very
little is as yet positively known, and nothing whatever has been ascertained
as to its nesting or eggs. The species was first met with by Mr. Townsend,
October 28, 1835, on the banks of the Columbia River, and was named by
Mr. Nuttall in honor of its discoverer. It is spoken of by these gentlemen
as having been a transient visitor only, stopping but a few days, on its way
north, to recruit and feed, previous to its departing for the higher latitudes in
which it spends the breeding-season. It is, however, quite as probable that
they disperse by pairs into solitary places, where for a while they escape observation.
When the season again compels them to migrate, they reappear
on the same path, only this time in small and silent flocks, as they slowly
move toward their winter quarters. These birds also are chiefly to be found
<!--321.png--><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 266]</span>
in the tops of the loftiest firs and other evergreens of the forests, where it is
almost impossible to procure them.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper observed one of this species at Shoalwater Bay, December 20,
1854. It was in company with a flock of Titmice and other small birds.
The following year, in November, he saw a small flock in California, frequenting
the willows in a low wet meadow, and was so fortunate as to
procure a pair.</p>

<p>Ridgway met with it in the East Humboldt Mountains, where it was
rather common in September, inhabiting the thickets of aspens, alders, etc.,
along the streams.</p>

<p>Mr. P. L. Sclater obtained several fine specimens of this Warbler from
the west coast of Central America, and Mr. Salvin found it a winter visitant
at Duenas, where he met with it even more frequently than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroica
virens</i>, with which he found it associated. Skins were found among the
birds taken by Dr. Van Patten in Guatemala. A single specimen has been
taken in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Boucard obtained specimens of this species in the mountainous district
of Totontepec, in the State of Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>

stain; the nape is olivaceous instead of black, and the black centres
to dorsal feathers more concealed; the ash above is less pure, and there is no
trace of streaks on the sides. A female (autumnal?)&mdash;38,141&mdash;from Orizaba,
Mexico, is grayish-olivaceous above, including the whole top of the head,
except beneath the surface; the feathers on top of head have conspicuous
black centres, but there are none on the back; the sides of the head, and
the bases of the feathers on its top, are soiled yellow; the throat is dirty
white, with the feathers dusky beneath the surface; the breast and sides
have a strong brownish tinge. Another female, and an autumnal one (probably
of the year), is more brown above, the specks on the top of the head
exceedingly minute; there are also obscure streaks along the sides, where
there is a strong brownish tinge.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Western or Hermit Wood Warbler, so far as known, is
limited in its distribution to the Pacific coast from Central America to Washington
Territory. Specimens procured from Volcan de Fuego, Mexico, Arizona,
and California, are in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.
But little is positively known as to its history or habits. Nuttall, who first
met with it in the forests on the banks of the Columbia, had no doubt
that it breeds in the dark forests bordering on that river. He described it as
a remarkably shy and solitary bird, retiring into the darkest and most silent
recesses of the evergreens, and apparently living among the loftiest branches
of the gigantic firs of that region. In consequence of its peculiar habits it
was with extreme difficulty that his party could get a sight of this retiring
species. Its song, which he frequently heard from these high tree-tops at
very regular intervals for an hour or two at a time, he describes as a faint,
moody, and monotonous note, delivered when the bird is at rest on some
lofty twig, and within convenient hearing of its mate.</p>

<p>Mr. Townsend, who was one of the same party, shot a pair of these birds
near Fort Vancouver, May 28, 1835. They were flitting among the tops of
the pine-trees in the depths of the forest, where he frequently saw them
hanging from the twigs, in the manner of Titmice. Their notes, uttered at
different intervals, he describes as very similar to those of the Black-throated
Blue Warbler (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. cærulescens</i>).</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley obtained, June, 1856, two specimens at Fort Steilacoom. He
also describes them as very shy, feeding and spending most of their time in the
tops of the highest firs, so high up as to be almost out of the reach of fine shot.
The species he regards as not at all rare on the Pacific coast, but only difficult
of procuring, on account of the almost inaccessible nature of its haunts.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues procured a single specimen of this species in Arizona early in
September. It was taken in thick scrub-oak bushes. He thinks it may be
a summer resident of that Territory, but, if so, very rare.</p>

<p>A single specimen was also obtained at Petuluma, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, by Mr. Emanuel
Samuels, May 1, 1856.
<!--323.png--><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 268]</span>
It was also observed, August 29, by Mr. Ridgway, among the bushes of a
cañon among the East Humboldt Mountains. He describes its single note
as a lisped <i class="birdcall">pzeet</i>.</p>

<p>Three individuals of this species were collected by Mr. Boucard in Southern
Mexico in 1862, and were referred by Dr. Sclater to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. chrysopœia</i> (<abbr title="Proceedings Zoölogical Society">P. Z. S.</abbr>,
1862, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 19). Subsequently Mr. Salvin described as a new species, under
the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. niveiventris</i>, other individuals of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. occidentalis</i> obtained
by him in Guatemala. The true specific relations of the specimens both
from Southern Mexico and Central America have since been made clear
by Dr. Sclater, Ibis, 1865, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 87, enabling us to give this species as a winter
visitant of the countries above named. Mr. Salvin states (Ibis, 1866, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 191)
that these birds were found in most of the elevated districts where pines
abound. He procured specimens in the Volcan de Fuego, in the hills above
the Plain of Salama, and near the mines of Alotepeque.</p>

<!--324.png--><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 269]</span>
Dr. Woodhouse states that it is common in Texas and New Mexico.
It was not, however, met with by any other of the government exploring
parties. Dr. Gerhardt found it quite common in Northern Georgia, where it
remains all the winter, and where it breeds very early in the season. On the
19th of April he found a nest of these birds with nearly full-grown young.
It has not been found in Maine by Professor Verrill nor by Mr. Boardman,
nor in Nova Scotia by Lieutenant Bland. Mr. Allen has found it breeding
abundantly in the western part of Massachusetts, where it is one of the
earliest Warblers to arrive, and where it remains until October. In 1861
they were abundant in the pine woods near Springfield as early as April 4,
although the ground at that time was covered with snow. During the last
weeks of April and the early part of May they frequent the open fields,
obtaining much of their food from the ground in company with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. palmarum</i>,
the habits of which, at this time, it closely follows. Later in the
season they retire to the pine forests, where they remain almost exclusively
throughout the summer, chiefly on the tops of the tallest trees. For a few
weeks preceding the first of October they again come about the orchards and
fields. In its winter migrations it does not appear to leave this country, and
has not been found in any of the West India Islands, in Mexico, nor in South
or Central America. It breeds sparingly in Southern Illinois.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones found these birds numerous in Bermuda late in September, but
they all disappeared a few weeks later. Dr. Bryant found them at Inagua,
Bahamas.</p>

<p>Wilson first noticed this Warbler in the pine woods of the Southern
States, where he found it resident all the year. He describes it as running
along the bark of pine-trees, though occasionally alighting and feeding on
the ground. When disturbed, it always flies up and clings to the trunks of
trees. The farther south, the more numerous he found it. Its principal food
is the seeds of the Southern pitch-pine and various kinds of insects. It was
associated in flocks of thirty in the depths of the pine barrens, easily recognized
by their manner of rising from the ground and alighting on the trunks
of trees.</p>

<p>Audubon also speaks of this bird as the most abundant of its tribe. He
met with them on the sandy barrens of East Florida on the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s River
early in February, at which period they already had nests. In their habits
he regarded them as quite closely allied to the Creepers, ascending the
trunks and larger branches of trees, hopping along the bark searching for
concealed larvæ. At one moment it moves sideways along a branch a few
steps, then stops and moves in another direction, carefully examining each
twig. It is active and restless, generally searching for insects among the
leaves and blossoms of the pine, or in the crevices of the bark, but occasionally
pursuing them on the wing. It is found exclusively in low lands, never
in mountainous districts, and chiefly near the sea.</p>

<p>Its nest is usually placed at considerable height, sometimes fifty feet or
<!--325.png--><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 270]</span>
more from the ground, and is usually fastened to the twigs of a small branch.
In Massachusetts it has but a single brood in a season, but at the South
it is said to have three.</p>

<p>The flight of this Warbler is short, and exhibits undulating curves of great
elegance. Its song is described as monotonous, consisting merely of continuous
and tremulous sounds. Mr. Audubon found none beyond New Brunswick,
and it has never been found in Nova Scotia so far as I am aware.</p>

<p>Both old and young birds remain in Massachusetts until late in October,
and occasionally birds are seen as far to the north as Philadelphia in midwinter.
At this season they abound in the pine forests of the Southern States,
where they are at that time the most numerous of the Warblers, and where
some are to be found throughout the year.</p>

<p>In the summer their food consists of the larvæ and eggs of certain kinds
of insects. In the autumn they frequent the Southern gardens, feeding on
the berries of the cornel, the box grape, and other small fruit. Mr. Nuttall
states that their song is deficient both in compass and in variety, though not
disagreeable. At times, he states, it approaches the simpler trills of the
canary; but is usually a reverberating, gently rising or murmuring sound like
<i class="birdcall">er-r´-r´r´r´r´r´-ah</i>, or in the springtime like <i class="birdcall">twe twe-tw tw tw-tw tw</i>, and sometimes
like <i class="birdcall">tsh-tsh-tsh-tw-tw-tw-tw</i>, exhibiting a pleasing variety in its cadences.
The note of the female is not unlike that of the Black and White
Creeper.</p>

<p>On the 7th of June, Mr. Nuttall discovered a nest of this Warbler in a Virginia
juniper-tree in Mount Auburn, some forty feet from the ground, and
firmly fixed in the upright twigs of a close branch. It was a thin but very
neat structure. Its principal material was the old and wiry stems of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polygonum tenue</i>, or knot-weed. These were circularly interlaced and inter-wound
with rough linty fibres of asclepias and caterpillars’ webs. It was
lined with a few bristles, slender root-fibres, a mat of the down of fern-stalks,
and a few feathers. Mr. Nuttall saw several of these nests, all made in a
similar manner. The eggs in the nest described were four, and far advanced
towards hatching. They were white, with a slight tinge of green, and were
freely sprinkled with small pale-brown spots, most numerous at the larger
end, where they were aggregated on a more purplish ground. The female
made some slight complaint, but immediately returned to the nest, though
two of the eggs had been taken.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall kept a male of this species in confinement. It at once became
very tame, fed gratefully from the hand, from the moment it was
caught, on flies, small earthworms, and minced flesh, and would sit contentedly
on any hand, walking directly into a dish of water offered for drink,
without any precautions, or any signs of fear.</p>

<p>Mr. J. G. Shute found a nest of these Warblers in Woburn as early as
May 8. It contained four eggs, the incubation of which had commenced.
Three other nests were also found by him in the same locality, all of them
<!--326.png--><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 271]</span>
between the 8th and the 24th of May, and all built on branches of the red
pine and near the top. Several nests of this Warbler, found in Lynn, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>,
by Mr. George O. Welch, are alike in their mode of construction, and differ
in their materials from other accounts. They are all somewhat loosely put
together, and are composed externally of fine strips of the bark of the red
cedar, fine inner bark of several deciduous trees, dry stalks of plants, the
exuviæ of insects, and fine dry grasses. The cavities of these nests, which
are comparatively large and deep, were lined with the fur of the smaller
mammals, the silky down of plants, and feathers. A few fine wiry roots
were also intermingled. These nests are about two and a half inches in
height and three in diameter.</p>

<p>The eggs of this Warbler are of a rounded oval shape, have an average
length of .72 of an inch, and a breadth of .55. They resemble in size and appearance
the eggs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. castanea</i>, but the spots are more numerous, and the
blotches larger and more generally distributed. The ground-color is a bluish-white.
Scattered over this are subdued tintings of a fine delicate shade of
purple, and upon this are distributed dots and blotches of a dark purplish-brown,
mingled with a few lines almost black.</p>

question not altogether settled to the minds of some. It was described by
Wilson from a single specimen obtained near the Blue Ridge of Virginia.
Audubon found another in the collection of the Zoölogical Society. From
this he made his drawing. A third has also been met with and described by
Vieillot. We know nothing in regard to its habits, except that its song is said
to be a single <i class="birdcall">screep</i>, three or four times repeated. Its breeding-habits, its
manner of migration, and the place of its more abundant occurrence, yet
remain entirely unknown.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Kirtland’s Warbler is so far known by only a few rare specimens
as a bird of North America, and its biography is utterly unknown.
The first specimen of this species, so far as is known, was obtained by Dr.
Jared P. Kirtland, of Cleveland, <abbr title="Ohio">O.</abbr>, in May, 1851. It was shot by that naturalist
in woods near that city, and was by him given to Professor Baird, who
described it in the Annals of the New York Lyceum. It appears to be
closely allied to both the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. coronata</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. auduboni</i>, and yet to be a specifically
distinct bird. A second specimen, in the cabinet of Dr. Samuel
Cabot, Jr., of Boston, was obtained at sea, between the islands of Cuba and
Abaco. A third specimen was obtained June 9, 1860, near Cleveland, and
is in the collection of Mr. R. K. Winslow, of that city. Another specimen
is also reported as having been obtained in the same neighborhood, but not
preserved; and Dr. Hoy, of Racine, <abbr title="Wisconsin">Wis.</abbr>, is confident that he has seen it in
the neighborhood of that place. At present all that we can give in regard
to its history, habits, or distribution must be inferred from these few and
meagre facts.</p>

<p>This species varies considerably in different stages, but can generally be
recognized. Immature specimens resemble those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. tigrina</i>, but differ in
the chestnut crown, browner back, less bright rump, brighter yellow of under
tail-coverts, smaller blotches on tail, no white bands on the wings, etc., as
well as in the shape of the bill.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Red-Poll Warbler belongs, in its geographical distribution,
to that large class of birds which visit high northern latitudes to breed, passing
back and forth over a wide extent of territory, from the West India
Islands to the extreme northern portions of the continent. Specimens have
been procured from Cuba, Jamaica, <abbr title="Santo">St.</abbr> Domingo, and the Bahamas, in fall,
winter, and spring, where, at such times, they seem to be generally quite
common. It has not been observed in Mexico or in Central or South
America. It has been met with on the western shore of Lake Michigan,
but nowhere farther to the west. It has been found in the Red River Settlement,
Fort George, Fort Simpson, and Fort Resolution, in the Hudson Bay
Territory. It is not known, so far as I am aware, to breed south of latitude
44<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. Wilson and Nuttall both state that this bird remains in Pennsylvania
through the summer, but they were probably misinformed; at least, there
is no recent evidence to this effect. Wilson also states that he shot specimens
<!--329.png--><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 274]</span>
in Georgia, near Savannah, early in February, and infers that some pass
the entire winter in Georgia, which is not improbable, as this bird can endure
severe weather without any apparent inconvenience.</p>

<p>There are several marked peculiarities in the habits of this Warbler which
distinguish it from every other of its genus. Alone of all the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroicæ</i>, so
far as is known, it builds its nest on the ground, and is quite terrestrial in its
habits, and, notwithstanding the statements of earlier writers, these are quite
different from all others of this genus. It has very little of the habits of the
Creeper and still less of the Flycatcher, while it has all the manners of the
true Ground Warbler, and even approximates, in this respect, to the Titlarks.</p>

<p>My attention was first called to these peculiarities by Mr. Downes of
Halifax, in the summer of 1851; and I was surprised to find it nesting on the
ground, and yet more to note that in all its movements it appeared fully as
terrestrial as the Maryland Yellow-Throat, or the Towhee Finch. Since then
Mr. Boardman and other naturalists have found its nest, which is always on
the ground.</p>

<p>Mr. MacCulloch, in the fourth volume of the Journal of the Boston
Natural History Society, has given an interesting paper upon the terrestrial
peculiarities of this species, showing them to be nearly identical with those
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">seiuri</i>, with whom he thinks it should be classed. In its terrestrial
movements this bird is shown to be quite at home, while other Warblers,
when driven by necessity to feed upon the ground, are awkward, and manifest
a want of adaptation.</p>

<p>Dr. Henry Bryant, another very close and accurate observer, in his notes
on the birds of the Bahamas, referring to this Warbler, speaks of it as extremely
abundant, but confined to the sea-shore. “Its habits,” he adds,
apparently with some surprise, “are decidedly terrestrial, and it approaches,
in this respect, to the Titlarks. They were constantly running along the
edges of the road, or else hopping amongst the low branches in the pastures.
I did not see a single individual seeking for food amidst the large trees.
These birds could be constantly seen running up and down in the market in
search of small flies. These they caught either on the ground or else by
hopping up a few inches, scarcely opening the wings, and alighting directly.”</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. Allen, in his Birds observed in Western Massachusetts, shows
that these peculiarities of habits in this Warbler had not escaped his notice.
He speaks of it as “frequenting, in company with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. pinus</i>, the edges of
thickets, orchards, and open fields, <em>and is much on the ground</em>.”</p>

<p>Mr. George A. Boardman, writing me from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen, March, 1867, says:
“The Yellow Red-Poll is one of our most common Warblers, and, unlike
most other Warblers, spends much of its time feeding upon the ground. It
is no uncommon thing to see a dozen or two on the ground in my garden at
a time, in early spring. Later in the season they have more of the habits of
other Warblers, and are in summer expert flycatchers. In the fall we again
see them mostly upon the ground, feeding with the Blue Snowbirds (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Junco</i>
<!--330.png--><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 275]</span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hyemalis</i>) and the Chipping Sparrow. They breed in old brushy pastures, and
very early, nesting alongside of some little knoll, and, I think, always upon
the ground. The nest is very warmly lined with feathers.”</p>

<p>Mr. MacCulloch, in the paper already referred to, states that during their
autumnal migrations they seem invariably to exhibit the habits of true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvicolidæ</i>,
gleaning among branches of trees for the smaller insects, and not
unfrequently visiting the windows of dwellings in search of spiders and
insects.</p>

<p>In their migrations through Massachusetts these Warblers are everywhere
quite abundant in the spring, but in their return in autumn are not observed
in the eastern part of the State, though very common in the western from
September into November, remaining long after all the other Warblers are
gone. None remain during the summer.</p>

<p>In Western Maine, Mr. Verrill states, it is quite common both in spring
and in fall, arriving in April, earlier than any other Warbler, and again
becoming abundant the last of September.</p>

<p>I found it plentiful in the vicinity of Halifax, where it occurs throughout
the summer from May to September.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway gives this species as perhaps the most numerous of the transient
visitants, in spring and fall, in Southern Illinois. It is very terrestrial
in its habits, keeping much on the ground, in orchards and open places, and
its movements are said to be wonderfully like those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthus ludovicianus</i>.</p>

<p>In the vibratory motions of its tail, especially when upon the ground,
these birds greatly resemble the Wagtails of Europe. They have no other
song than a few simple and feeble notes, so thin and weak that they might
almost be mistaken for the sounds made by the common grasshopper.</p>

<p>The Red-Poll usually selects for the site of its nest the edge of a swampy
thicket, more or less open, placing it invariably upon the ground. This is
usually not large, about three and a half inches in diameter and two and
a half in depth, the diameter and depth of the cavity each averaging only
half an inch less. The walls are compactly and elaborately constructed
of an interweaving of various fine materials, chiefly fine dry grasses, slender
strips of bark, stems of the smaller plants, hypnum, and other mosses.
Within, the nest is warmly and softly lined with down and feathers.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennicott met with a nest of this bird at Fort Resolution, June 18.
It was on the ground, on a hummock, at the foot of a small spruce, in a
swamp. When found, it contained five young birds.</p>

<p>Their eggs are of a rounded-oval shape, and measure .70 of an inch in
length by .55 in breadth. Their ground-color is a yellowish or creamy-white,
and their blotches, chiefly about the larger end, are a blending of
purple, lilac, and reddish-brown.</p>

not changed. A young male in autumnal dress is wholly brownish olive-green

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Prairie Warbler, nowhere an abundant species, is pretty
generally, though somewhat irregularly, distributed through the eastern portion
of the United States from Massachusetts to Georgia during its breeding-season.
The Smithsonian Museum embraces no specimens taken west of
Philadelphia or Washington. I have had its nest and eggs found in
Central New York. Mr. Audubon speaks of its occurring in Louisiana, but
his accounts of its nesting are so obviously inaccurate that we must receive
this statement also with misgivings. Wilson, however, obtained specimens
in Kentucky, and gave to it the inappropriate name of <em>Prairie</em> Warbler.
Nuttall regarded it as rare in New England, which opinion more careful
observations do not confirm. They certainly are not rare in certain portions
of Massachusetts. In Essex County, and, according to Mr. Allen, in the
vicinity of Springfield, they are rather common. The Smithsonian possesses
specimens from the Bahamas, Jamaica, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas, and other West
India islands. Dr. Gundlach speaks of it as common in Cuba. In the
Bahamas, Dr. Bryant found these Warblers more abundant than he had ever
known them in the United States. In January all the males were in winter
<!--332.png--><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 277]</span>
plumage, some not having changed by April to their summer costume. He
regarded them as constant residents of those islands. They had all paired
off by the middle of April.</p>

<p>In the island of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix, Mr. Edward Newton observed these Warblers from
the 10th of September to the 27th of March. They were present on the island
about two thirds of the year, and while they were found were very common.</p>

<p>In Jamaica, according to Mr. March, they are numerous throughout the
entire year, though less abundant during the summer months. They were
always plentiful in the gardens about the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Malpighia glabra</i>, capturing small
insects from the ripe fruit.</p>

<p>Mr. Gosse, on the contrary, regarded it as only a winter visitant of that
island, appearing by the 18th of August, and disappearing by the 11th of
April. He observed them among low bushes and herbaceous weeds, along
the roadside, near the ground, examining every stalk and twig for insects.
Others flew from bushes by the wayside to the middle of the road, where,
hovering in the air, a few feet from the ground, they seemed to be catching
small dipterous insects. Their stomachs were filled with fragments of insects.</p>

<p>Wilson found them usually in open plains and thinly wooded tracts, searching
most leisurely among the foliage, carefully examining every leaf or blade
of grass for insects, uttering, at short intervals, a brief <i class="birdcall">chirr</i>. They did not
appear to be easily alarmed, and he has known one of these birds to remain
half an hour at a time on the lower branch of a tree, and allow him to approach
the foot, without being in the least disturbed. He found their food
consisted of winged insects and small caterpillars.</p>

<p>In 1858, Mr. John Cassin wrote me: “The Prairie Warbler certainly
breeds in New Jersey, near Philadelphia. I have seen it all summer for the
last twelve years, and have seen the young just able to fly, but never found
the nest. It has a very peculiar note, which I know as well as I do the Catbird’s,
having often followed and searched it out. It frequents cedar-trees,
and I suspect breeds in and about them.”</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found the Prairie Warbler mostly a spring and autumn visitant
in the vicinity of Washington, being quite abundant during those seasons.
A few were observed to remain during the breeding-season. They arrive
earlier than most of this family of birds, or about the 20th of April. He
found them frequenting, almost exclusively, cedar-patches and pine-trees, and
speaks of their having very peculiar manners and notes.</p>

<p>Both Wilson and Audubon were evidently at fault in their descriptions of
the nest and eggs. These do not correspond with more recent and positive
observations. Its nest is never pensile. Mr. Nuttall’s descriptions, on the
other hand, are made from his own observations, and are evidently correct.
He describes a nest that came under his observation as scarcely distinguishable
from that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. æstiva</i>. It was not pensile, but fixed in a forked
branch, and formed of strips of the inner bark of the red cedar, fibres of asclepia,
and caterpillars’ silk, and thickly lined with the down of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gnaphalium</i>
<!--333.png--><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 278]</span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plantagineum</i>. He describes the eggs as having a white ground, sharp at one
end, and marked with spots of lilac-purple and of two shades of brown,
more numerous at the larger end, where they formed a ring. He speaks of
their note as slender, and noticed their arrival about the second week of
May, leaving the middle of September.</p>

<p>At another time Mr. Nuttall was attracted by the slender, filing notes of
this bird, resembling the suppressed syllables <i class="birdcall">’tsh-’tsh-’tsh-’tshea</i>, beginning
low and gradually growing louder. With its mate it was busily engaged
collecting flies and larvæ about a clump of locust-trees in Mount Auburn.
Their nest was near, and the female, without any precautions, went directly
to it. Mr. Nuttall removed two eggs, which he afterwards replaced. Each
time, on his withdrawal, she returned to the nest, and resorted to no expedients
to entice him away.</p>

<p>Several nests of this Warbler have been obtained by Mr. Welch in Lynn.
One was built on a wild rose, only a few feet from the ground. It is a snug,
compact, and elaborately woven structure, having a height and a diameter of
about two and a half inches. The cavity is two inches wide and one and a
half deep. The materials of which the outer parts are woven are chiefly the
soft inner bark of small shrubs, mingled with dry rose-leaves, bits of vegetables,
wood, woody fibres, decayed stems of plants, spiders’ webs, etc. The
whole is bound together like a web by cotton-like fibres of a vegetable origin.
The upper rim of this nest is a marked feature, being a strongly interlaced
weaving of vegetable roots and strips of bark. The lining of the nest
is composed of fine vegetable fibres and a few horse-hairs. This nest, in its
general mode of construction, resembles all that I have seen; only in others
the materials vary,&mdash;in some dead and decayed leaves, in others remains
of old cocoons, and in others the pappus of composite plants, being more
prominent than the fine strips of bark. The nests are usually within four
feet of the ground. The eggs vary from three to five, and even six.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Gerhardt found this bird the most common Warbler in Northern
Georgia. There its nests were similar in size, structure, and position,
but differed more or less in the materials of which they were made. The
nests were a trifle larger and the walls thinner, the cavities being correspondingly
larger. The materials were more invariably fine strips of inner bark
and flax-like vegetable fibres, and were lined with the finest stems of plants,
in one case with the feathers of the Great Horned Owl. In that neighborhood
the eggs were deposited by the 15th of May.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts the Prairie Warbler invariably selects wild pasture-land,
often not far from villages, and always open or very thinly wooded. In
Georgia their nests were built in almost every kind of bush or low tree, or
on the lower limbs of post-oaks, at the height of from four to seven feet.
Eggs were found once as early as the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> of May, and once as late as the 10th
of June. The birds arrived there by the 10th of April, and seemed to
prefer hillsides, but were found in almost any open locality.</p>

<p><!--334.png--><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 279]</span>
In Southern Illinois, Mr. Ridgway cites this species as a rather rare bird
among the oak barrens where it breeds. He also met with it in orchards in
the wooded portions, in April, during the northward migration of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvicolidæ</i>.</p>

<p>The eggs are of an oval shape, pointed at one end, and measure .68 by .48
of an inch. They have a white ground, marked with spots of lilac and purple
and two shades of umber-brown.</p>

Bill rather sylvicoline, compressed, with a distinct notch. Gonys ascending.
Rictal bristles very short. Wings moderate, about three quarters of an inch longer
than the tail; first quill scarcely shorter than the
second. Tail slightly rounded; feathers acuminate.
Tarsi about as long as the skull, considerably
exceeding the middle toe. Under
tail-coverts reaching within about half an inch
of the end of the tail. Color above olivaceous;
beneath whitish, thickly streaked on the breast
and sides. Wings and tail immaculate. Nests
on the ground, often arched or sheltered by position
or dry leaves. Eggs white, marked with
red, brown, and purple.</p>

<p>This genus is decidedly sylvicoline in general appearance, although the
spots on the breast resemble somewhat those of the Thrushes. The three
species may be grouped as follows:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Golden-crowned Thrush, or Oven-Bird, as in some portions
of the country it is exclusively called,
inhabits the whole of eastern North
America, as far to the west as the Great
Plains, and to the north at least as far
as English River. In the winter season
it has been found in Mexico, <abbr title="Santo">St.</abbr> Domingo,
Jamaica, Cuba, and other West India
islands, and in Central America is also
very common. Mr. Sumichrast also
speaks of it as common at Orizaba
during the same season, and it has been
found in the Bermudas and the Bahamas.
In all these places it usually appears early in the autumn and remains until
the ensuing spring. It breeds as far to the north as it has been known to go.
Richardson met with its nest on the banks of the Saskatchewan, and was
<!--336.png--><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 281]</span>
convinced that it bred at even still higher latitudes. Among some memoranda
I received from the late Mr. Kennicott is one stating that he met
with this Thrush breeding near English River, July 15. These birds arrive
in the fur country about the first of May. How far to the south they breed
we have no positive information. I have never received its eggs from any
point south of Philadelphia, nor did I ever meet with it or hear its notes
in summer in the vicinity of Washington. Audubon was of the opinion
that a few remain to breed even in Louisiana, and states that he found them
abundant in Texas in the middle of May, but he may have confounded this
species with the Louisiana Thrush.</p>

<p>In Jamaica, where its habits have been carefully studied by Mr. Gosse, it
arrives in September and leaves about the 20th of April. Mr. Würdemann
obtained specimens at Cape Florida, September 24 and 25. Mr. Audubon
mentions their appearing in Louisiana as early as the first of March. Wilson
never noticed it in Louisiana before the last of April, nor after September.
The Smithsonian possesses no specimen obtained earlier than May 1, except
some procured April 25 from the mouth of Platte River. Mr. Allen notes
its arrival in Western Massachusetts May 10. Mr. Verrill gives the early
part of May as the time of its reaching Western Maine, and Mr. Boardman
May 1 for the vicinity of Calais.</p>

<p>Though not found on the California coast, specimens of this bird have
been taken in winter near Mazatlan, Mexico, showing probably that in their
migrations they cross the mountains of Northern Mexico, as do the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mniotilta
varia</i> and a few other of our Eastern species.</p>

<p>In Eastern Massachusetts it usually appears from the 1st to the 10th of
May, just as the first leaves of the trees are expanding, and is to be found
only in thick woods, often near their edges. Occasionally found perched on
the low limbs of trees, it is quite terrestrial in its habits, keeps a good deal
on the ground, running about among the fallen leaves, more in the manner
of a small quadruped than a bird. Mr. Audubon speaks of its frequenting
shady woods, watered by creeks and rivulets. I have found them rather
more abundant in woods upon high and dry ground, usually upon slopes of
wooded hillsides. In this respect it appears to differ in a marked manner
from its near of kin, the Water Thrush (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. noveboracensis</i>).</p>

<p>This bird, and indeed all of this genus, have the peculiar vibratory motions
of the tail noticed in the Wagtail of Europe, and also observed in our
own Red-poll Warbler, and in the Titlarks. In consequence of these peculiarities
this species is known, in Jamaica, as <cite>Land Kickup</cite>, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">noveboracensis</i>
as the <cite>Water Kickup</cite>. Mr. Gosse found in its stomach gravel,
various seeds, mud-insects, caterpillars, and small turbinate shells.</p>

<p>The usual and more common song of this species is a very peculiar and
striking one, unlike that of any other of our birds. It is said to somewhat
resemble the song of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Accentor modularis</i> of Europe. It is loud and clear,
enunciated with great rapidity, and uttered with great emphasis at its close.
<!--337.png--><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 282]</span>
It is characterized by energy and power, rather than variety or sweetness, yet
it is not unpleasing. Audubon calls it a “simple lay,” and again “a short
succession of simple notes,”&mdash;expressions that would give one who had never
heard its song an altogether incorrect idea of its true character. Wilson is
still more in error when he states that this bird has no song, but an energetic
twitter, when, in fact, it has two very distinct songs, each in its way remarkable.
Nuttall describes its song as “a simple, long, reiterated note, rising
from low to high, and shrill”; Richardson speaks of it as “a loud, clear, and
remarkably pleasing ditty”; and Mr. Allen calls it “a loud, echoing song,
heard everywhere in the deep woods.” In reference to the songs of this bird,
and the injustice that has been done by writers to this and other species
of our birds, Mr. Boardman of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen has written me the following just
observations.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Many of our common Warblers, Thrushes, and other birds, have rare songs
they reserve for some extra occasions, and many of our common birds do not
get credit for half their real power of song. Once last spring, as I was watching
for some birds, I heard a new and very pretty warble, something like
the trill of a Winter Wren, and found that it came from our common slate-colored
Snowbird (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Junco hyemalis</i>), a bird that I see every day that I go
to the woods, and yet these notes I had never heard before. It is the same
with the Golden-crowned Thrush. When it gets into the top of a tall tree,
its strain is so rare and beautiful that but few know it as from that bird.
The same is true of the Water Thrush, and also of both <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus pallasi</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus swainsoni</i>.”</p>

<p>The Oven-Bird always nests on the ground, and generally constructs nests
with arched or domed roofs, with an entrance on one side, like the mouth of
an oven, and hence its common name. This arched covering is not, however,
universal. For a site this species usually selects the wooded slope of a hill,
and the nests are usually sunk in the ground. When placed under the
shelter of a projecting root, or in a thick clump of bushes, the nest has no
other cover than a few loose leaves resting on, but forming no part of it.</p>

<p>A nest from Racine, <abbr title="Wisconsin">Wis.</abbr>, obtained by Dr. Hoy, is a fine typical specimen
of the domed nests of this species. The roof is very perfect, and the whole
presents the appearance of two shallow nests united at the rim, and leaving
only a small opening at one side. This nest was five inches in diameter
from front to back, six inches from side to side, and four inches high. The
opening was two and a quarter inches wide, one and three quarters high.
The cavity was two inches deep, below the brim. At the entrance the roof
recedes about an inch, obviously to allow of a freer entrance and exit from
the nest. Externally this nest is made of wood, mosses, lichens, and dry
leaves, with a few stems and broken fragments of plants. The entrance is
strongly built of stout twigs, and its upper portion is composed of a strong
framework of fine twigs, roots, stems, mosses, dry plants, etc., all firmly
interwoven, and lined with finer materials of the same.</p>

<p><!--338.png--><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 283]</span>
On the 7th of June, 1858, I came accidentally upon a nest of this bird
of a very different style of structure. It was in a thick wood in Hingham.
The nest was built in a depression in the ground at the foot of some low bushes,
and its top was completely covered by surrounding vines and wild flowers.
It would probably have escaped notice had not my daughter, then a child
of four years, attempted to gather some wild flowers growing directly over
its entrance. This flushed the mother, who until then had remained quiet,
although we were standing with our feet almost upon the nest, and the bird
fluttered and tumbled about at our feet with well-feigned manœuvres to distract
our attention. The child in great glee sought to catch it, but it eluded her
grasp, and, running off like a mouse, disappeared. The nest contained six
eggs, was entirely open, and with no other cover than the wild plants that
clustered above it. As to its identity there was no doubt, as the parent was
afterwards snared upon its nest. This nest was somewhat loosely constructed
of skeleton leaves, dry slender stalks, grasses, and pine-needles, and was
lined with a few slender grasses and leaves. It had a diameter of six inches,
and was two and a half inches deep. The cup had a diameter of three and
a half inches and a depth of two, being very large for the size of the bird,
probably owing to the shape of the cavity in which it was sunk.</p>

<p>The nest of this bird seems to be a favorite place of resort for the Cow
Blackbird to deposit its egg. In one nest, found by Mr. Vickary in Lynn,
no less than three eggs of these parasites had been placed.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Golden-crowned Thrush are subject to considerable variations.
Their markings differ in their colors and shades, and yet more in number,
size, and manner of distribution. The eggs are oval in shape, one end
being but very slightly smaller than the other. Their average length is .82
of an inch, and their breadth is .55 of an inch. Their ground-color is a beautiful
creamy-white. They are marked, usually principally about the larger
end, with dots and blotches, intermingled, of red, reddish-brown, lilac, darker
purple, and ferruginous. Occasionally these make a beautiful crown around
the larger end, leaving the rest of the surface nearly free from spots.</p>

Bill, from rictus, about the length of the skull. Above olive-brown, with a
shade of green; beneath pale sulphur-yellow, brightest on the abdomen. Region about
the base of the lower mandible, and a superciliary line from the base of the bill to the nape,
brownish-yellow. A dusky line from the bill through the eye; chin and throat finely
spotted. All the remaining under parts and sides of the body, except the abdomen, and
including the under tail-coverts, conspicuously and thickly streaked with olivaceous-brown,
almost black on the breast. Length, 6.15; wing, 3.12; tail, 2.40. Bill, from rictus, .64.
Sexes similar.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern Province of North America, north to Arctic Ocean and Yukon (westward
along northern border of United States to Cascade Mountains); Fort Bridger, (<span class="sc">Drexler</span>);
Arizona (<span class="sc">Coues</span>); whole West Indies; Southeastern Mexico; all Central America;
Panama and Eastern South America (Bogota; Carthagena; Brazil).</p>

<p>A very young bird (22,619, Fort Simpson, August 10) is very different
from the adult in coloration. The upper parts are fuliginous-black, each
feather with a broad terminal bar of pale ochraceous, wing-coverts tipped
with the same, forming two distinct bands; streaks below as in the adult,
but broader and less sharply defined.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species has a general distribution, at certain seasons,
throughout the whole of eastern North America as far to the north as the
Arctic Ocean. North of the United States it is also found on the Pacific
coast as far south as the Cascade Mountains. In the winter it is quite common
in all the West India Islands, in Southeastern Mexico, Central America,
Panama, and the eastern part of South America to Brazil. From about latitude
43<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> northward it breeds throughout all North America. Sir John Richardson
met with it at the Carlton House, where it was found frequenting the
moist and thickly wooded banks of the river. These birds made their first
appearance in May, and the greater portion soon after disappeared, as if proceeding
still farther north to breed.</p>

<p>Among other memoranda given me by the late Mr. Kennicott was one
furnished him by Mr. Lockhart, to the effect that, at Yukon River, June 21,
1859, he had shot a female Water Thrush as she flew from her nest. This
contained five eggs, and was concealed under a small pile of drift, close to
the river, but under large willow-trees. This was not lined with down. At
the same locality another nest with six eggs was also obtained. This also
was on the ground at the foot of some willows near the water. It was made
of moss, and lined with very fine grass.</p>

<p>All that has been given by our earlier authors as to the habits of this
species must be received with more or less uncertainty. The difference between
this bird and that known as the Louisiana Thrush has not been sufficiently
clear to these writers to enable us always to determine which of the
<!--340.png--><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 285]</span>
two they had in view. And even now the distribution in summer of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludovicianus</i> is hardly definable with precision.</p>

<p>Wilson describes the habits of those he observed in Pennsylvania as
evincing a remarkable partiality for brooks, rivers, ponds, and the vicinity
of water generally, wading in shallow pools in search of aquatic insects, and
giving, as it moves it along, an almost continuously vibratory motion to its
tail. He speaks of it as very shy, darting away with signs of alarm whenever
approached, and uttering a sharp cry. In all other respects his account
of this bird probably refers to the Louisiana species.</p>

<p>This is also, without doubt, true of nearly all Audubon gives in connection
with the history of this Thrush, which in all probability does not breed in
Louisiana, nor remain there through April, being at that time well on its way
to more northern regions.</p>

<p>Mr. Gosse, in his notes on the birds of Jamaica, states that this bird reappears
in that island about the end of August. He noticed them about the
muddy margins of ponds, and they soon became abundant. Individuals
were also to be seen running on the road, especially near the sea-shore, and
by the edges of morasses. They ran rapidly, often waded up to their tibiæ
in water, or ran along the twigs of a fallen tree at the brink, and now and
then flew up into the branches of a pimento or an orange-tree. Whether
running or standing, they were continually flirting up their tails, after the
manner of the European Wagtail. During its winter residence in Jamaica
it has no song, only a monotonous cry, a sharp <i class="birdcall">chip</i>. Its stomach was
found to contain water-insects and shells. Mr. March has noticed their
arrival in Jamaica as early as August 5. They all leave by the first of
April.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen found these birds not uncommon both in spring and in fall in
the vicinity of Springfield. He thinks a few breed there, as he has met with
them in the months of June, July, and August, very sparingly however.
They arrive about the 12th of May. I have once, at least, met with its
nest and eggs near Boston.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues says this bird is quite common, both in the spring and fall,
near Washington, and breeds sparingly, having been found there in July.
They arrive about the first of May, are eminently aquatic, frequent swampy
thickets and thick dark woods interspersed with pools, where they associate
with the Solitary Tatler.</p>

<p>In Southern Illinois this species, Mr. Ridgway states, is found only during
its migrations and in mild winters. He never met with it in the breeding-season,
when the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. ludovicianus</i> is so abundant. But it returns early from
the North, and he has shot numbers of them in August. During the whole
fall they are common about all swampy places, or the margin of creeks in the
woods; and in mild winters a few are found in the swamps of the bottom-lands,
where the dense forest affords them comfortable shelter. On warm
days in December and January, he has heard them singing with all the vigor
<!--341.png--><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 286]</span>
of spring in such localities. In notes, as well as in manners, Mr. Ridgway
has noticed little difference between this species and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. ludovicianus</i>. The
song, however, is decidedly weaker, though scarcely less sweet, and the two
are very easily distinguished at sight by one familiar with them.</p>

<p>These birds breed, though they are not very abundant, in the vicinity of
Calais, and also in the western part of Maine. Professor Verrill states that
they reached the neighborhood of Norway, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>, about the first of May, a fortnight
earlier than Mr. Allen noted their arrival in Springfield. Mr. Verrill
demonstrated the fact of their breeding in Western Maine, by finding, June 8,
1861, a nest and eggs in a dense cedar swamp near Norway. This was built
in an excavation in the side of a decayed moss-covered log, the excavation
itself forming an arch over the nest in the manner of, yet different from,
that of the Golden-crowned. The nest itself was an exceeding beautiful
structure, four and a half inches in diameter, but only an inch and a half in
depth, being very nearly flat, the cavity only half an inch deep. The entire
base was made of loose hypnum mosses, interspersed with a few dead leaves
and stems. The whole inner structure or lining was made up of the fruit-stems
of the same moss, densely impacted. The outer circumference was
made up of mosses and intertwined small black vegetable roots.</p>

<p>This nest contained five eggs, the brilliant white ground of which, with
their delicately shaded spots of reddish-brown, contrasted with the bright
green of the mossy exterior, and set off to advantage by the conspicuous and
unique lining, produce a very beautiful effect.</p>

<p>Mr. George A. Boardman of Calais, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>, an observing and accurate naturalist,
has furnished me with the following interesting account of the habits
of this species and its congener, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurocapillus</i>, in a letter dated <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Stephen, March 23, 1867. “Did you ever notice their walk on the ground?
You know that most of our birds are hoppers. These two, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. noveboracensis</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. aurocapillus</i>, have a beautiful gliding walk, and of all our other birds
I only remember two that are not hoppers, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthus ludovicianus</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molothrus pecoris</i>. I do not think that a naturalist should ever say, as
Wilson was constantly doing, that any bird has no note or song whatever,
unless he is well acquainted with them, at all times, especially while breeding.
Many birds seem really to have nothing to say except when mating.
I think that our little walker, the Water Thrush, has been particularly ill
used by writers in this respect, for I regard him as one of our liveliest singers.
Its note is very high and clear, begins with a sudden outburst of melody,
so as almost to startle you, is very clear and ringing, as if the bird had just
found its mate after a long absence. It then keeps falling until you can
hardly hear it. Its note is very sweet, and can be heard when you are in a
canoe or boat a very long ways. Like most of our Warblers and Thrushes,
when singing, they do not like intrusion, and it was a long while before I
could make out the bird that uttered these notes. I could only do it by
going in a boat or canoe. They hide in thick trees, over the water, where it
<!--342.png--><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 287]</span>
is impossible to walk up to them. I almost always find them on some
island, in a river, that, has been overflowed, and always very near the water.”</p>

<p>Their eggs vary in length from .81 to .87 of an inch, and in breadth from
.65 to .69. They have an oblong-oval shape, tapering to a point at one end
and rounded at the other. Their ground is a clear crystal-white, and they are
more or less marked with lines, dots, and dashes of varying shades of umber-brown.
These markings are more numerous around the larger end, and are
much larger and bolder in some than in others, in many being mere points
and fine dots, and in such cases equally distributed over the whole egg. In
others a ring of large confluent blotches is grouped around the larger end,
leaving the rest of the egg nearly unmarked.</p>

<p>Autumnal specimens have a more or less strong wash of ochraceous over
the flanks and crissum, and the brown above
rather darker and less grayish than in spring
birds.</p>

<p>This species is very similar to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. noveboracensis</i>,
although readily distinguishable by
the characters given in the diagnoses. The
differences in the bill there referred to are
illustrated in the accompanying diagram.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Water Thrush described by Wilson as most abundant in
the lower part of the Mississippi Valley, as well as that given by Audubon
as the Louisiana Water Thrush, though its position as a genuine species was
afterwards abandoned, are undoubtedly referable to a closely allied but apparently
<!--343.png--><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 288]</span>
distinct <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Seiurus</i>, now known as the Louisiana Water Thrush. This
bird has a very close resemblance to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">noveboracensis</i>, differing chiefly in
size and in having a larger bill. Although its distribution is not yet fully
determined, it seems to belong rather to the South and Southwestern States,
and only accidentally to be found north of the Middle States. Still a single
specimen has been obtained in Massachusetts, and it has been several times
found in Michigan and Missouri. Specimens of this bird have also been
procured in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Tamaulipas, Mexico, Cuba, Jamaica, and
Guatemala.</p>

<p>Its recognition as a distinct species from the common Water Thrush is
so recent, and the two species so closely resemble each other, that as yet its
habits and history are imperfectly known. Wilson refers to the birds he
had met with in Mississippi and Louisiana, which we presume to have been
the same, as being there in abundance, and eminently distinguished by the
loudness, sweetness, and expressive vivacity of their notes. These he describes
as beginning very high and clear, and as falling with an almost imperceptible
gradation until they are scarcely articulated,&mdash;a description that
would also answer very well for the song of the true Water Thrush. During
their song, he adds, they are perched on the middle branches of a tree over
the brook or river-bank, pouring out a charming melody, so loud and distinct
that it may be heard at the distance of nearly half a mile. The voice of this
bird appeared to him so exquisitely sweet and expressive that he was never
tired of listening to it.</p>

<p>It is also quite probable that nearly all of Audubon’s accounts of the habits
of the Water Thrush were derived from his observation of this species, and
not of its Northern congener. He describes its song as fully equal to that
of the Nightingale, its notes as powerful and mellow, and at times as varied.
He states that it is to be found at all seasons in the deepest and most swampy
of the canebrakes of Mississippi and Louisiana. Its song is to be heard even
in the winter, when the weather is calm and warm.</p>

<p>He describes its flight as easy and continued, just above the brakes, or
close to the ground. When on the ground, it is continually vibrating its
body, jerking out its tail and then closing it again. It walks gracefully along
the branches or on the ground, but never hops. He states that it feeds on
insects and their larvæ, and often pursues the former on the wing.</p>

<p>He describes the nest as placed at the foot and among the roots of a tree,
or by the side of a decayed log, and says they are often easily discovered.
They are commenced the first week of April. The outer portions are formed
of dry leaves and mosses, the inner of fine grasses, with a few hairs or the
dry fibres of the Spanish moss.</p>

<p>The eggs, four in number, are described as flesh-colored, sprinkled with
dark red at the larger end. They are hatched in fourteen days. The young
leave the nest in about ten days, and follow the parent on the ground from
place to place. When disturbed on her nest in the earlier periods of incubation,
<!--344.png--><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 289]</span>
she merely flies off; but later, or when she has young, she tumbles
about on the ground, spreads her wings and tail, utters piteous cries, and
seems as if in the last agonies of despair. This species Mr. Audubon never
met with farther east than Georgia, nor farther north than Henderson, <abbr title="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr></p>

<p>Of late years, or since attention has been more drawn to the specific
difference between this species and the Water Thrush, it has apparently
become more numerous, and has been obtained in considerable numbers in
the vicinity of Washington. In that neighborhood, once considered so
rare, it was found by Dr. Coues to be not at all uncommon at certain
seasons and in particular localities. From the 10th of April to the 20th
of May it was always to be met with among the dense laurel-brakes that
border the banks of and fill the ravines leading into Rock Creek and Piney
Branch. He believes they breed there, but they were not observed in the
fall. They were usually very shy, darting at once into the most impenetrable
brakes, but were at other times easily approached. He always found
them in pairs, even as early as the 20th of April. Their call-note was a
sparrow-like chirp, as if made by striking two pebbles together. They also
had a loud, beautiful, and melodious song, the singularity of which first drew
his attention to the bird.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway informs me that in the Wabash Valley this bird, familiarly
known as the “Water Wagtail,” is an abundant summer sojourner. It inhabits
the dampest situations in the bottom-lands, the borders of creeks, lagoons,
and swamps, living there in company with the Prothonotary Warbler (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Protonotaria
citrea</i>). In its movements it is one of the quickest as well as the
most restless of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvicolidæ</i>, though it is eminently terrestrial in its habits.
It is usually seen upon the wet ground, in a horizontal position, or even
the posterior part of its body more elevated, and its body continually tilting
up and down; if it fancies itself unobserved, it runs slyly beneath the brushwood
overhanging the shore; but if startled, it flies up suddenly with a sharp
and startling chatter. He adds that in early spring (from the latter part of
February to the beginning of April) its rich loud song may be heard before
the trees are in leaf, for it is one of the earliest of the Warblers to arrive.
When singing, it is usually perched upon the lower branches of a tree overhanging
the water, but he has frequently seen it among the topmost branches.
Wilson and Audubon have not exaggerated the merits of the song of this
bird, for among all its family there is certainly not one of our North American
species that compares with it. In richness and volume of its very liquid
notes it is almost unrivalled, though the song itself may not be considered
otherwise remarkable.</p>

<p>Mr. Salvin met this species in different portions of Guatemala in the months
of August, September, and November, 1859. A dry watercourse in the forest,
or in the bottom of a barranco, seemed to be its favorite resort, while
its near congener, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">noveboracensis</i>, was observed to seek rather the more
open streams.</p>

A specimen in the collection of the Philadelphia Academy, killed by Mr.
Krider, has the darker ash of the jugulum of a decided sooty tinge.</p>

<p>A peculiarity in the history of this species is shown in the fact that it is
quite abundant in Illinois, Wisconsin, etc., in the spring, and very rare in
the autumn; precisely the reverse being the case near the Atlantic border,
where only two or three spring specimens have been announced as captured
by collectors. It is possible that they go north in spring, along the valley of
the Mississippi, and return in autumn through the Atlantic States. Their
summer abode and breeding-place are as yet unknown.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Of the history of this rare and beautiful species but little is as
yet known. It was first met with by
Wilson, in the State of Connecticut,
and he afterwards obtained two other
specimens near Philadelphia. Others
have since been procured at Carlisle,
Penn., at Washington, Loudon County,
<abbr title="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, near Chicago, Racine, and in Southern
Illinois. September 25 to October
1, and May, from the 15th to the
28th, appears to be the epoch of their
fall and spring occurrence. They are
more frequently noticed in the autumn.
It is supposed to be a migratory bird, going north to breed.</p>

<p>It was found by Wilson, in every case, among low thickets, and seemed to
be more than commonly active, not remaining for a moment in the same
position. Mr. Audubon obtained only two specimens, a pair, opposite Philadelphia
in New Jersey. When he first observed them they were hopping
and skipping from one low bush to another, and among the tall reeds of the
marsh, emitting an oft-repeated <i class="birdcall">tweet</i> at every move. They were chasing a
species of spider that ran nimbly over the water, and which they caught by
gliding over it. Upon dissecting them, he found a number of these spiders
in their stomachs, and no other food. These two birds were not at all shy,
and seemed to take very little notice of him, even when close to them.</p>

<p>Mr. Trumbull, in his list of the birds of Eastern Pennsylvania, marks it
as a summer resident of that State, which is probably not the fact. Mr. Lawrence
includes it in his list of birds found near New York City. It is not
given by Mr. Verrill or Mr. Boardman as occurring in any part of Maine, and
has not been detected in Western Massachusetts by Mr. Allen, though it has
been occasionally met with in the eastern part of the State by Dr. Cabot, Mr.
Maynard, and others. More recently, in the fall of 1870, and again in that
of 1871, this species has been found quite abundant in a restricted locality
in the eastern part of that State. It was first observed by Mr. H. W. Henshaw,
a promising young naturalist, in the early part of September, 1870,
among the Fresh Pond marshes in Cambridge. They appeared to be quite
<!--349.png--><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 292]</span>
numerous, and several specimens were obtained. He communicated the discovery
to his friend, Mr. William Brewster, and more than fifty specimens
of this rare Warbler were obtained during that season. In the following
autumn, in September and during the first few days of October, these birds
were observed in the same locality, apparently in greater numbers, and
more specimens were obtained.</p>

<p>Mr. Henshaw writes me that he first saw this species, September 7, 1870,
when he obtained a single specimen. From that time until September 27 it
was very common throughout the Fresh Pond swamps, to which locality it
seemed to be restricted. It again made its appearance in 1871, and at about
the same time, and remained until October 5. It was in even greater numbers
than during the preceding year.</p>

<p>Their habits, while with us in the fall, appear to be very different from
those of the individuals observed by Wilson and Audubon, which were
described as being of a remarkably lively disposition, and hence the name of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agilis</i>. Mr. Henshaw found them almost constantly engaged in seeking their
food upon the ground. When startled, they would fly up to the nearest bush,
upon which they would sit perfectly motionless, in a manner closely resembling
the Thrushes. If not further disturbed, they immediately returned to
the ground and resumed the search for food among the leaves. If greatly
startled, they took a long flight among the bushes, and could rarely be found
again. The only note he heard them utter was a single sharp chirp, emitted
occasionally, when surprised. They were all remarkably fat, so much so as
to make it difficult to obtain a good specimen.</p>

<p>About sunset, standing on the skirts of the swamp, he has repeatedly observed
these birds alight, in great numbers, on the edge, and immediately
pass in, evidently intending to remain there over night. He judged that
they migrate entirely by day. On only one or two occasions did he observe
these birds feeding in the tops of willow-trees. At such times they
appeared equally lively in their movements with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroica striata</i>, in
company with which they were associated. The birds he saw were nearly
all in immature plumage, adults being comparatively rare.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues states that the Connecticut Warbler is found near Washington
in the month of October, but that it is rather uncommon. He did not
meet with it in spring. He speaks of its frequenting old buckwheat and
corn fields, searching for food among the dry, rank weeds, and also in swampy
places among low thickets.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Kentucky Warbler is an abundant species in the Southern
and Southwestern States, and has been found, though more rarely, as far to
the north as Southern New York in the east and to Southern Wisconsin in
the west. It has also been obtained at Fort Riley, in Kansas. Its nest and
eggs have been procured near Cleveland, <abbr title="Ohio">O.</abbr>, by Dr. J. P Kirtland, and also
in Chester County, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>, by Mr. Norris. It is a winter inhabitant in
Mexico, Panama, Guatemala, and Cuba.</p>

<p>Wilson speaks of having met with this bird in abundance from Kentucky to
the mouth of the Mississippi, everywhere quite common, but most especially
so in the States of Tennessee and Kentucky. At the Balize he several times
heard it twittering among the high rank grass of those solitary morasses.
He found it frequenting low damp woods, and building its nest either in the
middle of thick tufts of rank grass, in the fork of a low bush, or on the
ground. The materials of which these nests were made were loose dry
grass, mixed with the pith of wood, and lined with hair. He found the eggs
from four to six in number, pure white, sprinkled with reddish specks. He
met with the female sitting upon her eggs as early as May. These birds,
he adds, are seldom seen among high branches, but prefer to frequent low
bushes and canebrakes. In their habits they are very lively and sprightly.
The song is loud, comprising three notes, and resembles <i class="birdcall">tweedle-tweedle-dweedle</i>.
It makes its appearance in Kentucky from the South about the middle
of April, and leaves the region about New Orleans on the approach of cold
weather. Wilson was assured that it never remains there during the winter.</p>

<p>Wilson characterizes these birds as a reckless fighting species, almost
always engaged in pursuing its fellows.</p>

<p><!--351.png--><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 294]</span>
Mr. Audubon states that this Warbler is the most common and abundant
species that visits the State of Louisiana and the whole region about the
Mississippi River, but is not so common in Kentucky or Ohio. He describes
it as an extremely lively and active bird, found in all the low grounds
and damp places near watercourses, and generally among the tall rank weeds
and low bushes growing in rich alluvial soil. It is continually in motion,
hopping from stalk to stalk, and from twig to twig, preying upon insects,
larvæ, or small berries, rarely pursuing an insect on the wing. He describes
its song as agreeable and emphatic. He has never known this species fly
farther than a few yards at a time. Its flight is low, and is performed in a
gliding manner. It makes its first appearance about the middle of March,
and remains until the middle or last of September. He states that it rears
two broods in a season. His description of its nest, as “small, beautifully
constructed, and attached to several stems of rank weeds,” etc., does not agree
in position, size, or appearance with any that I have ever seen.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Audubon, it feeds largely upon spiders, which it obtains
by turning over the withered leaves on the ground. The young birds resemble
their mother until the following season, when the males attain the full
beauty of their plumage. They remain with their parents until they migrate.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Alexander Gerhardt, an accurate and observing naturalist of
Northern Georgia, informed me, by letter, that the nest of the Kentucky
Warbler is usually built on the ground, under a tuft of grass, often on a hillside
and always in dry places. The eggs are deposited from the 4th to the
15th of May. Nearly all the nests he met with were made externally of a
loose aggregation of dry oak and chestnut leaves, so rudely thrown together
as hardly to possess any coherence, and requiring to be sewed to be kept in
place. The interior or inner nests were more compactly interwoven, usually
composed of fine dark-brown roots. Instead of being small, they are large
for the bird, and are inelegantly and clumsily made. They measure four
inches in their diameter, three in height, and two in the depth of their cavity.
One nest, the last received from Dr. Gerhardt, obtained by him at Varnell’s
Station, in Northern Georgia, June 5, 1860, is large and peculiar in its
construction. It is nearly spherical in shape, with an entrance partially on
one side and nearly arched over. The periphery of this nest is composed
exclusively of partially decayed deciduous leaves, impacted together, yet
somewhat loosely. Within this outer covering is a fine framework of stems,
twigs, and rootlets, and within this a snug, compact lining of hair and finer
rootlets and fibres. This nest is six inches in diameter and five in height.
It contained four eggs.</p>

<p>These eggs have an average length of .69 of an inch and a breadth of .56
of an inch. They have an oblong-oval shape, a crystalline-white ground, and
the entire surface is sprinkled over with fine dots of red and reddish-brown.
These, though most abundant about the larger end, are nowhere confluent,
and do not form a crown.</p>

<p><!--352.png--><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 295]</span>
A nest of this bird from Chester County, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>, is a very flat structure,
evidently built in a bed of fallen leaves. It has a diameter of six inches and
a height of only two. The cup is a mere depression only half an inch in
depth. Its base is loosely constructed of dried leaves, upon which is interwoven
a coarse lining of long, dry, and wiry rootlets and stems of plants.
It was given to Mr. J. P. Norris, from whom I received it, and it is now in
the Boston collection.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Ridgway furnishes the following valuable information in regard
to the abundance and general habits of this species as observed in Southern
Illinois: “It is a very common summer bird in Southern Illinois, where it
arrives in the Wabash Valley towards the last of April. It is a wood-loving
species, and of terrestrial habits, like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Seiurus aurocapillus</i>, but generally frequents
rather different situations from the latter bird, liking better the undergrowth
of ‘bottom’ woods than that of dry forests. In all its manners it
closely resembles the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Seiuri</i>, especially the two aquatic species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludovicianus</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">noveboracensis</i>, having the same tilting motion of the body, and horizontal
attitude when perching, so characteristic of these birds. The nest I have
never found, though well aware of its actual situation. I knew of one somewhere
among the ‘top’ of a fallen tree, but it was so well concealed that
the closest search did not enable me to discover it. In most cases the nest is
probably on the ground, among the rubbish of fallen tree-tops, or low brushwood.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The usual note of this Warbler is a sharp <i class="birdcall">tship</i>, almost precisely like that
of the Pewee (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sayornis fuscus</i>), uttered as the bird perches on a twig near the
ground, continually tilting its body, or is changed into a sharp rapid twitter
as one chases another through the thicket. Their song is very pretty, consisting
of a fine whistle, delivered very much in the style of the Cardinal
Grosbeak (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cardinalis virginianus</i>), though finer in tone, and weaker.”</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found this Warbler rare at Washington, and chiefly in low
woods with thick undergrowth, and in ravines. They were very silent, but
not shy, and a few breed there.</p>

<p>There is very much variation manifested in a large series (containing more
than one hundred and thirty specimens, principally North American), though
<!--355.png--><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 298]</span>
but very little that accords with any distinctions of habitat. As a rule,
however, those from the Atlantic States are the smallest of the series, and
have most white on the abdomen, the yellow being restricted to the throat
and jugulum, and the lower tail-coverts. In most specimens from the Mississippi
Valley the yellow beneath is quite continuous, and the size considerably
larger than in the series above mentioned, in these respects approaching
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">G. melanops</i> from Eastern Mexico, in which the yellow pervades the
whole surface beneath; but in this the
whitish border above the black mask is
extended over the whole crown, leaving
the nape only distinctly brownish, and
the size larger than the average of
the series alluded to. However, No.
61,135 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, Liberty County, <abbr title="Georgia">Ga.</abbr>, has even
more white on top of the head, the whole
occiput being of this color; while No.
7,922 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, from Racine, <abbr title="Wisconsin">Wis.</abbr>, is quite as
long as the type of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melanops</i> (the tail
only, shorter), and there is nearly as
much yellow beneath. The Georgia specimen, however, in other respects,
is most like the Atlantic style. Specimens from the Pacific coast have just
appreciably longer tails than Eastern ones, and the olive-green above is
brighter. Jamaican and Guatemalan specimens are identical with many from
the United States. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">G. rostratus</i> of Bryant, from the Bahamas, appears
to be merely a gigantic insular race of the common species.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This well-known and beautiful little Ground Warbler is a common,
abundant, and widely diffused species, occurring throughout the United
States from ocean to ocean, and from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada and
Nova Scotia. It is found, during the winter months, in Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico,
Yucatan, Guatemala, Costa Rica, the Bahamas, and, in the fall, in Bermuda.
On the Pacific coast it has been found from Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas to the
British territories. It breeds from Northern Georgia to Halifax, inclusive.</p>

<p>In Central America, Mr. Salvin states that this Warbler is by far the most
common of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mniotiltidæ</i>, but is wholly migratory. It was usually found
in the neighborhood of water, frequenting the reeds that surrounded Lake
Duenas, and the bushes on the banks of its outlet. It was also taken by
Mr. Boucard at <a id="chg6" name="chg6"></a>Totontepec, among the mountains of Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>

<p>It was observed as far to the north as Lake of the Woods, by Mr. Kennicott.
Several were there observed, both males and females, May 29. It is
everywhere quite common, and is, I think, as numerous in New England as
in the Middle States.</p>

<p>For the most part it seems to prefer wild lands, especially those overgrown
with briers and low bushes, to open or cultivated grounds. Yet this preference
is not exclusive, as I have known a pair, or their offspring, to visit the
<!--356.png--><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 299]</span>
same garden nine or ten successive summers. It is also more generally found
in low lands than in high, and is probably attracted to moist thickets of
briers and underbrush by the greater abundance of its favorite food. This
Warbler is eminently terrestrial in its habits, never being found among higher
limbs, but always either on the ground or among the lower branches of
bushes, vines, and weeds. It is a diligent rather than an active or nimble
bird, is always on the move, and incessantly in search of its food. This consists
of insects in all their forms, but more particularly of larvæ, small
beetles, and spiders. They are of great service in the destruction of several
forms of injurious grubs, and but that their mode of life exposes them to
destruction by prowling cats, I doubt not they would readily adapt themselves
to living in our gardens. Occasionally they are found in fields of grain,
where their presence is due to the abundance of destructive insects.</p>

<p>The Yellow-Throat appears shy and retiring because it prefers to move back
and forth among low shrubs and brambles, where it most readily procures its
food, but it is not a timid bird. They are unsuspecting, and will as readily
permit as fly from the near presence of man. I have frequently had them
approach within a few feet, especially when at rest; and even when in motion
they will continue their lively song, as they move about from twig to
twig. Though able to capture an insect on the wing, they are not expert fly-catchers,
and chiefly take their prey when it is at rest.</p>

<p>Their song is a very lively and agreeable refrain, easily recognized, though
exhibiting at times marked differences, and occasionally closely resembling
the song of the Summer Yellow-Bird. The same brief series of notes, usually
sounding like <i class="birdcall">whi-ti-tēē-tēē</i>, is constantly repeated at short intervals, while
the singer continues his perpetual hunt for insects.</p>

<p>The male is very affectionate and devoted to both mate and offspring. The
pair are never far apart, and during incubation the male is assiduous in the
collection of food, feeding its mate, and afterwards assisting in collecting for
their young. They rely upon concealment for the protection of their nest, and
rarely show any open solicitude until it is discovered. Then they will make
the most vehement demonstrations of alarm and distress, flying about the
intruder and fearlessly approaching him to within a few feet. In Massachusetts
they rarely, if ever, have more than one brood in a season. The young
are able to take care of themselves early in July. At that time the song of
the male ceases, or is abbreviated to a single <i class="birdcall">whit</i>, and parents and young
form a family group and together hunt in the more secluded thickets, the
edges of woods, and other retired places, for their food. Early in September
they take their departure.</p>

<p>The Yellow-Throat is distributed, in suitable localities, over a large area,
and wherever found is apparently equally common. Dr. Gerhardt found it
quite abundant in Northern Georgia. Wilson and Audubon thought it more
common in the Middle States than farther north, but I have found it quite as
numerous about Halifax and Eastport as I have at Washington. Dr. Cooper
<!--357.png--><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 300]</span>
speaks of it as “very common” in Washington Territory, though not so
abundant as MacGillivray’s Warbler. The same writer also states it to be a
“very common bird” in California. Their earliest arrival at San Diego was
on the 17th of April, about the time they reach Pennsylvania. They appear
in New England early in May.</p>

<p>Their nest is almost invariably upon the ground, usually in a thick bed
of fallen leaves, a clump of grass or weeds, at the roots of low bushes or
briers, or under the shelter of a brush-pile. Occasionally it has been found
among high weeds, built in a matted cluster of branches, four or five feet
from the ground. Sometimes it is sunk in a depression in the ground, and
often its top is covered by loose overlying leaves. I have never found this
top interwoven with or forming any part of the nest itself.</p>

<p>The nest is usually both large and deep for the size of the bird, its loose
periphery of leaves and dry sedges adding to its size, and it often has a depth
of from five to six inches from its rim to its base. The cavity is usually
three inches deep and two and a quarter wide. Generally these nests are
constructed on a base of dry leaves. An external framework, rudely put together,
of dry grasses, sedge leaves, strips of dry bark, twigs, and decaying
vegetables, covers an inner nest, or lining, of finer materials, and more carefully
woven. At the rim of the nest these materials sometimes project like
a rude palisade or hedge. Usually the lining is of fine grasses, without hair
or feathers of any kind.</p>

<p>In some nests the outer portion and base are composed almost entirely of
fine dry strips of the inner bark of the wild grape.</p>

<p>The eggs vary from four to six in number, and also differ greatly in
their size, so much so that the question has arisen if there are not two species,
closely resembling, but differing chiefly in their size. Of this, however, there
is no evidence other than in these marked variations in the eggs.</p>

<p>In the Great Basin, Mr. Ridgway found this bird abundant in all the
bushy localities in the vicinity of water, but it was confined to the lower
portions, never being seen high up on the mountains, nor even in the lower
portions of the mountain cañons.</p>

<p>Their eggs exhibit a variation in length of from .55 to .72 of an inch, and
in breadth from .48 to .58 of an inch; the smallest being from Georgia, and
the largest from Kansas. They are of a beautiful clear crystalline-white
ground, and are dotted, blotched, and marbled around the larger end with
purple, reddish-brown, and dark umber.</p>

Costa Rica (<abbr title="Lawrence"><span class="sc">Lawr.</span></abbr>).</p>

<p>Specimens vary in the amount of black on the jugulum, and the purity
of the ash of the throat. The species is often confounded with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oporornis
agilis</i>, to which the resemblance is quite close. They may, however, be distinguished
by the much longer and more pointed wings, and more even tail,
shorter legs, etc., of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agilis</i>. The white ring round the eye in the female
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">philadelphia</i> increases the difficulty of separation.</p>

<p>The adult male in autumn is scarcely different from the spring bird, there
being merely a faint olive-tinge to the ash on top of the head, and the black
jugular patch more restricted, being more concealed by the ashy borders to
the feathers; the yellow beneath somewhat deeper.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Mourning Warbler was first discovered and described by
Wilson, who captured it in the early part of June, on the borders of a marsh,
within a few miles of Philadelphia. This was the only specimen he ever
met with. He found it flitting from one low bush to another in search of
insects. It had a sprightly and pleasant warbling song, the novelty of which
first attracted his attention. For a long while Wilson’s single bird remained
unique, and from its excessive rarity Bonaparte conjectured that it might
be an accidental variety of the Yellow-Throat. At present, though still
of unfrequent occurrence, it is by no means a doubtful, though generally
a comparatively rare species. Audubon mentions having received several
specimens of this Warbler, procured in the neighborhood of Philadelphia,
New York, and Vermont, all of which were obtained in the spring or summer
months. He met with a single specimen in Louisiana, and thinks its
habits closely resemble those of the Maryland Yellow-Throat.</p>

<p><!--359.png--><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 302]</span>
Nuttall met with what he presumes to have been one of these birds in the
Botanical Garden at Cambridge. It had all the manners of the Yellow-Throat,
was busy in the search of insects in the low bushes, and, at intervals, warbled
out some very pleasant notes, which partly resembled the lively chant of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trichas</i>, and in some degree the song of the Summer Yellow-Bird.</p>

<p>Professor Reinhardt states that two individuals of this species have been
taken in Greenland,&mdash;one in Fiskenæsset, in 1846, and the other at Julianhaab,
in 1853.</p>

<p>Mr. Turnbull gives it as still quite rare in Eastern Pennsylvania, arriving
there in the middle of May on its way farther north. Mr. Lawrence includes
it in his list of the birds of New York. Mr. Dresser obtained five specimens
early in May, in Southern Texas.</p>

<p>It has been met with as far to the north as Greenland by Reinhardt, and
in Selkirk Settlement by Donald Gunn. It has been procured in Eastern
Mexico, in Panama, in Carlisle, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>, Southern Illinois, Missouri, Nova
Scotia, and various other places. It has been known to breed in Waterville,
<abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>, and is not uncommon in Northwestern and Northern New York. A
single specimen of this bird was obtained at Ocana, in Colombia, South
America, by Mr. C. W. Wyatt.</p>

<p>Late in May, 1838, I have a note of having met with this species in Mount
Auburn. The bird was fearless and unsuspecting, busily engaged, among
some low shrubbery, in search of insects. It suffered our near presence, was
often within a few feet, and was so readily distinguishable that my companion,
with no acquaintance with birds, at once recognized it from Audubon’s
plates. Its habits were the exact counterpart of those of the Yellow-Throat.
We did not notice its song.</p>

<p>Mr. Maynard states that, May 21, 1866, Mr. William Brewster shot a male
of this species in Cambridge, on the top of a tall tree. Another specimen
was taken at Franconia Mountains, New Hampshire, August 3, 1867. It was
in company with four fully fledged young, which it was feeding. The young
were shy, and could not be procured. The old bird was catching flies, after
the manner of Flycatchers. Mr. Maynard has met this species but once in
Massachusetts, and then in May, among low bushes and in a swampy place.
He has since found it rather common at Lake Umbagog, Maine, in June, where
it breeds. He states that it frequents the bushes along fences, stone walls, and
the edges of woods. The male often perches and sings in the early morning
on the top rail of a fence, or the dead branch of a tree. Its song he speaks
of as loud and clear, somewhat resembling that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Seiurus noveboracensis</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Paine considers this Warbler to be very rare in Vermont. He once
observed a pair, with their young, at Randolph. The male was singing a
quite pleasing, though somewhat monotonous song.</p>

<p>Mr. George Welch met with these birds in the Adirondack region, New
York, in June, 1870. They seemed rather abundant, and were evidently
breeding there. He obtained a single specimen.</p>

<p><!--360.png--><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 303]</span>
Mr. John Burroughs, of Washington, was so fortunate as to obtain the
nest and eggs of this Warbler near the head-waters of the Delaware River,
in Roxbury, Delaware County, <abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr> “The nest,” he writes me, “was
in the edge of an old bark-peeling, in a hemlock wood, and was placed in
some ferns about one foot from the ground. The nest was quite massive, its
outer portions being composed of small dry stalks and leaves. The cavity
was very deep, and was lined with fine black roots. I have frequently
observed this Warbler in that section. About the head of the Neversink
and Esopus, in the northwest part of Ulster County, New York, they are the
prevailing Warbler, and their song may be heard all day long. Their song
suggests that of the Kentucky Ground Warbler, but is not so loud and fine.”
Mr. Burroughs states elsewhere that “the eggs, three in number, were of
light flesh-color, uniformly speckled with fine brown specks. The cavity of
the nest was so deep that the back of the sitting bird sank below the edge.”</p>

<p>Their eggs are of an oblong-oval shape, pointed at one end. They measure
.75 by .55 of an inch. Their ground-color is a pinkish-white, and they are
marked with dots and blotches, of varying size, of dark purplish-brown.</p>

rounded wing, the first quill being intermediate between the fifth and sixth,

jugulum broader, concealing more the black. The adult female in autumn
is considerably more dully colored than in spring.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This comparatively new Warbler was first met with by Townsend,
and described by Audubon in the last volume of his Ornithological
Biography. It has since been found to have a wide range throughout the
western portion of North America, from Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas to British America,
and from the Plains to the Pacific. It has also been obtained at Choapan
in the State of Orizaba, Mexico, by Mr. Boucard, and in Guatemala by
Mr. Salvin, who states that throughout the district between the volcanoes of
Agua and Fuego this was a common species, frequenting the outskirts of the
forests and the edges of the clearings. It breeds in abundance in Utah,
Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Washington Territory, and probably also in Northern
California.</p>

<p>Townsend first met with it on the banks of the Columbia. He states that
it was mostly solitary and extremely wary, keeping chiefly in the most impenetrable
thickets, and gliding through them in a cautious and suspicious
manner. Sometimes it might be seen, at midday, perched upon a dead twig,
over its favorite places of concealment, at such times warbling a very sprightly
and pleasant little song, raising its head until its bill is nearly vertical.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall informed Mr. Audubon that this Warbler is one of the most
common summer residents of the woods and plains of the Columbia, where
it appears early in May, and remains until the approach of winter. It
keeps near the ground, and gleans its subsistence among the low bushes. It
is shy, and when surprised or closely watched it immediately skulks off, often
uttering a loud <i class="birdcall">click</i>. Its notes, he states, resemble those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Seiurus
aurocapillus</i>. On the 12th of June a nest was brought to Mr. Nuttall, containing
two young birds quite fledged, in the plumage of the mother. The
nest was chiefly made of strips of the inner bark of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thuja occidentalis</i>,
lined with slender wiry stalks. It was built near the ground in the dead,
moss-covered limbs of a fallen oak, and was partly hidden by long tufts of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usnea</i>. It was less artificial than the Yellow-Throat’s nest, but was of the
same general appearance. On his restoring the nest to its place, the parents
immediately approached to feed their charge.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley found this Warbler very abundant between the Cascade Mountains
and the Pacific coast. Like all Ground Warblers it was entirely insectivorous,
all the stomachs examined containing coleoptera and other insects.
He did not find them shy, but as they frequented thick brush they were very
difficult to procure.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found this species very common about Puget Sound, frequenting
the underbrush in dry woods, occasionally singing a song from a low tree,
similar to that of the Yellow-Throat. He found its nest built in a bush, a
foot from the ground. It was of straw, loosely made, and without any soft
lining. Dr. Cooper found this species as far east as Fort Laramie, in Wyoming.
They reach the Columbia River by the <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> of May.</p>

<p><!--362.png--><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 305]</span>
The same writer noticed the first of this species at Fort Mojave, April 24.
He regarded their habits as varying in some respects from those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trichas</i>,
as they prefer dry localities, and hunt for insects not only in low bushes but
also in trees, like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroicæ</i>. Dr. Cooper twice describes their eggs as
white, which is inaccurate. He thinks that some of them winter in the
warmer portions of California. He regards them as shy, if watched, seeking
the densest thickets, but brought out again by their curiosity if a person
waits for them, and the birds will approach within a few feet, keeping up a
scolding chirp.</p>

<p>The nests of this species obtained by Dr. Kennerly from Puget Sound
were all built on the ground, and were constructed almost exclusively of
beautifully delicate mosses, peculiar to that country. They are shallow nests,
with a diameter of four and a height of two inches, the cavity occupying a
large proportion of the nest. Its walls and base are of uniform thickness,
averaging about one inch. The nests are lined with finer mosses and a few
slender stems and fibres.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found these Warblers breeding in great numbers, June 23,
1869, at Parley’s Park, Utah, among the Wahsatch Mountains. One of
these nests (<abbr title="Smithsonian Institution">S. I.</abbr>, 15,238) was in a bunch of weeds, among the underbrush
of a willow-thicket along a cañon stream. It was situated about eight inches
from the ground, is cuplike in shape, two inches in height, three in diameter,
and somewhat loosely constructed of slender strips of bark, decayed stalks of
plants, dry grasses, intermixed with a few fine roots, and lined with finer
materials of the same. The cavity is one and a half inches in depth, and two
in diameter at the rim.</p>

<p>The eggs, four in number, are .75 of an inch in length and .50 in
breadth. Their ground-color is a pinkish-white, marbled and spotted with
purple, lilac, reddish-brown, and dark brown, approaching black. The blotches
of the last color vary much in size, in one instance having a length of .21
of an inch, and having the appearance of hieroglyphics. When these spots
are large, they are very sparse.</p>

<p>“This species,” Mr. Ridgway writes, “inhabits exclusively the brushwood
along the streams of the mountain cañons and ravines. Among
the weeds in such localities numerous nests were found. In no case were
they on the ground, though they were always near it; being fixed between
upright stalks of herbs, occasionally, perhaps, in a brier, from about one to
two feet above the ground. The note of the parent bird, when a nest was
disturbed, was a strong <i class="birdcall">chip</i>, much like that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanospiza amæna</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C.
cyanea</i>.” He also states that it was abundant in the East Humboldt Mountains
in August and in September, and also throughout the summer. A
pair of fully fledged young was caught on the 21st of July.</p>

Bill broad at base, but contracting rapidly and becoming attenuated when
viewed from above; high at the base
(higher than broad opposite the nostrils);
the culmen and commissure much curved
from base; the gonys straight. Upper jaw
deeper than the lower; bill without notch
or rictal bristles. Nostrils circular, edged
above with membrane, the feathers close
to their borders. Wings shorter than tail,
considerably rounded; first quill rather
shorter than the sixth. Tail moderately
graduated; the feathers rounded, but narrow.
Middle toe without claw about
two thirds the length of tarsus, which has
the scutellæ fused externally in part into one plate.</p>

<p>The precise systematic position of the genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icteria</i> is a matter of much
contrariety of opinion among ornithologists; but we have little hesitation in
including it among the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvicolidæ</i>. It has been most frequently assigned
to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireonidæ</i>, but differs essentially in the deeply cleft inner toe (not
half united as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireo</i>), the partially booted tarsi, the lengthened middle
toe, the slightly curved claws, the entire absence of notch or hook in the bill,
and the short, rounded wing with only nine primaries. The wing of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireo</i>,
when much rounded, has ten primaries,&mdash;nine only being met with when
the wing is very long and pointed.</p>

<p>Of this genus only one species is known, although two races are recognized
by naturalists, differing in the length of the tail.</p>

It is not very rare in Massachusetts, but

<p>Probably no one of our birds has more distinctly marked or greater peculiarities
<!--365.png--><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 308]</span>
of voice, manners, and habits than this very singular bird. It is
somewhat terrestrial in its life, frequenting tangled thickets of vines, briers,
and brambles, and keeping itself very carefully concealed. It is noisy and
vociferous, constantly changing its position and moving from place to place.</p>

<p>It is not abundant north of Pennsylvania, where it arrives early in May
and leaves the last of August. The males are said always to arrive three or
four days before their mates.</p>

<p>This species is described by Wilson as very much attached to certain
localities where they have once taken up their residence, appearing very
jealous, and offended at the least intrusion. They scold vehemently at
every one who approaches or even passes by their places of retreat, giving
utterance to a great variety of odd and uncouth sounds. Wilson states that
these sounds may be easily imitated, so as to deceive the bird itself, and to
draw it after one; the bird following repeating its cries, but never permitting
itself to be seen. Such responses he describes as constant and rapid,
and strongly expressive both of anger and anxiety, their voice, as it shifts,
unseen, from place to place, seeming to be more like that of a spirit than a
bird. These sounds Wilson compares to the whistling of the wings of a
duck, being repetitions of short notes, beginning loud and rapid, and falling
lower and lower. Again a succession of other notes, said to closely
resemble the barking of young puppies, is followed by a variety of hollow,
guttural sounds, each eight or ten times repeated, at times resembling the
mewing of a cat, only hoarser,&mdash;all of these, as he states, uttered with
great vehemence, in different keys and with peculiar modulations, now as if
at a considerable distance, and the next moment as if close by your side;
so that, by these tricks of ventriloquism, one is utterly at a loss to ascertain
from what particular quarter they proceed. In mild weather this strange
melody of sounds is kept up throughout the night during the first of the
pairing-season, but ceases as soon as incubation commences.</p>

<p>They construct their nest about the middle of May. These are placed
within a few feet of the ground, in the midst of low brambles, vines, and
bushes, generally in a tangled thicket. They build a rude but strongly woven
nest, the outer portions more loosely made of dry leaves; within these are
interwoven thin strips of the bark of the wild grape, fibrous roots, and fine
dry grasses.</p>

<p>The eggs, four or five in number, are usually hatched out within twelve
days, and in about as many more the young are ready to leave their nest.</p>

<p>While the female is sitting, and still more after the young are hatched, the
cries of the male are loud and incessant when his nest is approached. He
no longer seeks to conceal himself, but rises in the air, his legs dangling in a
peculiar manner, ascending and descending in sudden jerks that betray his
great irritation.</p>

<p>The food of this bird consists chiefly of beetles and other insects, and
of different kinds of berries and small fruit, and it said to be especially fond
of wild strawberries.</p>

<p><!--366.png--><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 309]</span>
Audubon states that in their migrations they move from bush to bush by
day, and frequently continue their march by night. Their flight at all times
is short and irregular. He also states that when on the ground they squat,
jerk their tails, spring on their legs, and are ever in a state of great activity.
Although the existence of this bird north of Pennsylvania is generally
disputed, I have no doubt that it has always been, and still is, a constant
visitor of Massachusetts, and has been found to within a score of miles of
the New Hampshire line. Among my notes I find that a nest was found
in Brookline, in 1852, by Mr. Theodore Lyman; in Danvers, by Mr. Byron
Goodale; in Lynn, by Messrs. Vickary and Welch; and in many other parts
of the State. It certainly breeds as far south as Georgia on the coast, and
in Louisiana and Texas in the southwest. On the Pacific coast it is replaced
by the long-tailed variety, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">longicauda</i>.</p>

<p>A nest of this species from Concord, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, obtained by Mr. B. P. Mann,
and now in the collection of the Boston Natural History Society, has a
diameter of four inches and a height of three and a half. The cavity has a
depth of two and a quarter inches, and is two and a half wide. This is built
upon a base of coarse skeleton leaves, and is made of coarse sedges, dried
grasses, and stems of plants, and lined with long, dry, and wiry stems of
plants, resembling pine-needles. Another from Pomfret, <abbr title="Connecticut">Conn.</abbr>, obtained by
Mr. Sessions, is a much larger nest, measuring five inches in diameter and
three and three quarters in height. The cup is two and a half inches deep
by three in width. It is made of an interweaving of leaves, bark of the
grapevine, and stems of plants, and is lined with fine, long wiry stems and
pine-needles.</p>

<p>Their eggs are of a slightly rounded oval shape, vary in length from .85
to .95 of an inch, and in breadth from .65 to .70. They have a white ground
with a very slight tinge of yellow, and are marked with reddish-brown and
a few fainter purplish and lilac spots.</p>

Western and Middle Provinces of United States, east to Missouri River and
Texas; Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas and Western Mexico.</p>

<p>The most tangible difference between this bird and typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">virens</i> consists
in the longer tail. In addition, the upper plumage is grayish, with
hardly any olive tinge, and the white maxillary stripe extends farther back;
the bill is not so deep as that of the Eastern bird. All these differences,
however, are in strict accordance with various laws; the more grayish cast
of plumage is what we should expect in birds from the Middle Province,
while the restriction of the yellow from the maxillæ we see also in Western
specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Helminthophaga ruficapilla</i>; the longer tail, also, is a well-known
characteristic of Western birds, as distinguished from Eastern of the
same species.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, therefore, taking into consideration the absolute identity
of their habits and notes, we can only consider the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I. longicauda</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I. virens</i> as restricted, as being merely geographical races of one species.</p>

<p>This variety, as well as the Eastern, has in autumn and winter a slightly
different plumage. A pair (53,348 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, and 53,347 <abbr title="female symbol">♀</abbr>, West Humboldt Mountains,
Nevada) obtained September 4 differ in the following respects from
spring adults: the upper plumage is decidedly brown, with even a russet
tinge,&mdash;not gray, with a greenish wash; the lores are less purely black, and
the sides and crissum are deep cream-color, instead of pure white; the female
has a shade of olive across the jugulum; both male and female have the
lower mandible almost wholly white, and the commissure broadly edged with
the same.</p>

<p><abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 38,402 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, Laramie Peak, June, has the throat and jugulum strongly
stained with deep cadmium-orange.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Western or Long-tailed Chat has an exclusively Western distribution,
and has been found from Mexico and Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas to Oregon, on
the Pacific coast, and as far to the east as the Upper Missouri.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Cooper, these birds appear in San Diego and at Fort
Mojave in the latter part of April. They are said to inhabit chiefly the
warmer valleys near streams and marshes, rarely on the coast. At Fort Mojave,
Dr. Cooper found a nest of this bird May 19, built in a dense thicket of
algarobia. It contained three eggs, and one of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molothrus</i>. The nest was
built of slender green twigs and leaves, lined with grass and hair. The eggs
were white, sprinkled with cinnamon, somewhat in the form of a ring near
the larger end, and measured .75 by .64 of an inch.</p>

<p>These nests were usually very closely concealed, but one that he found at
Santa Cruz, near the coast, was in a very open situation, only two feet above
the ground. When the nest is approached, the old birds are very bold, keeping
up a constant scolding, and almost flying in the face of an intruder. At
<!--368.png--><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 311]</span>
other times they are very shy. The notes and sounds uttered by the Western
bird Dr. Cooper states to be the same as those of the Eastern species,
and with the same grotesqueness. They leave the State of California on or
before the first of September.</p>

<p>Dr. Gambel states that the Chat appears in California about the middle of
April, resorting to the hedges, vineyards, and bushy portions of gardens to
breed.</p>

<p>Mr. Xantus found a nest of this bird (<abbr title="Smithsonian Institution">S. I.</abbr>, 896) at Fort Tejon, California,
in May. It is a very symmetrical and exactly circular nest, six inches wide
and three in height. The cavity has a diameter of three inches at the brim,
and a depth of two. It is built of soft strips of bark, large stems, and
branches of dry plants, leaves, twigs, and other vegetable substances. These
are very neatly and compactly interwoven. The nest is elaborately lined with
finer stems and flexible grasses. Another nest (<abbr title="Smithsonian Institution">S. I.</abbr>, 1816), obtained at Neosho
Falls, Kansas, by Mr. B. F. Goss, is of irregular shape. Its height is four
inches, and its diameter varies from three and three quarters to five inches.
It was built in a depression in the ground, and its shape adapted to its location.
The base is composed entirely of leaves, impacted when in a moist and
decaying condition. Within these is interwoven a strong basket-like structure,
made of long and slender stems, strips of bark, and fine rootlets, lined
with finer grasses and stems of plants.</p>

<p>A nest of this species from Sacramento is composed, externally, of fine
strips of inner bark of the grape and of deciduous trees, coarse straws, stems
of plants, twigs, and dried remains of weeds, etc. It is lined with finer
stems and long wiry roots, resembling hair. This nest has a diameter of four
inches and a height of three. The cavity has a diameter of three inches at
the rim, and a depth of two.</p>

<p>In regard to this variety Mr. Ridgway writes: “In no respect that I could
discover does this Western bird differ from the Eastern in habits, manners,
or notes. The nesting-habits are exactly the same.”</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are, for the most part, larger than are those of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">virens</i>. They vary in length from .95 to 1.00 of an inch, and have an average
breadth of .70 of an inch. Their markings do not differ essentially in
shadings from those of the common species.</p>

Sylvicoline birds with the characters of Flycatchers; the bill notched at
tip, depressed and broad at the base, though quite deep; the rictus with well-developed
bristles reaching beyond the nostrils, sometimes to the end of the bill. First quill rather
less than the fourth, or still shorter. Size of the species rarely exceeding six inches.

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyrannidæ</i> in the structure of the bill, etc., and in the habit of capturing
insects more or less on the wing, though they are more restless in their
movements, seeking their prey among trees or in bushes, rapidly changing
their place, instead of occupying a perch and returning to it after pursuing
an insect through the air. The yellow or orange crown found in many species
also carries out the analogy; but the strictly Oscine characters of the
tarsal scutellæ and the nine primaries will serve to distinguish them.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Setophaginæ</i> have their greatest development in Middle and South
America, no less than nine genera and subgenera being on record, of which
only two extend into the United States. Of one of these, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Setophaga</i>, we
have only a single species of the many described; the other, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myiodioctes</i>,
has no members other than those found in the United States.</p>

Bill broad, depressed; the lateral outlines a little concave; the bristles
reaching not quite half-way from nostrils to tip.
Culmen and commissure nearly straight to near the
tip. Nostrils oval, with membrane above. Wings
pointed, rather longer than the nearly even but
slightly rounded tail; first quill shorter than the
fourth, much longer than the fifth; the second and
third quills longest. Tarsi rather lengthened, the
scutellar divisions rather indistinct; the middle toe
without claw, about three fifths the tarsus.</p>

<p>This genus is distinguished from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Setophaga</i>,
mainly by stouter feet and longer toes; shorter
and more even tail, narrower bill, etc. The species are decidedly muscicapine
in general appearance, as shown by the depressed bill with bristly
rictus. The type <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. mitratus</i> is very similar in character of bill to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroica
castanea</i>, but the wings are much shorter; the tail longer and more
graduated; the legs and hind toe longer, and the first primary shorter than
the fourth (.15 of an inch less than the longest), not almost equal to the
longest. The species are plain olive or plumbeous above, and yellow beneath.

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This beautiful and singularly marked Warbler is a Southern species,
though not exclusively so. It is
more abundant in South Carolina than
any other State, so far as I am aware.
It is, however, found as far to the north
as Northern New Jersey and Pennsylvania,
and Southern New York, and,
farther west, as far north as the shores
of Lake Erie. It has also been found in
Bermuda, Cuba, Jamaica, Eastern Mexico,
Honduras, and Guatemala. Throughout
Central America it appears to be abundant during the winter.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon also states that it abounds in Louisiana and along the banks
of the Mississippi and the Ohio. It occurs on the Hudson to some distance
above New York. It appears from the South early in March, and has young
already hatched, in Louisiana, early in May.</p>

<p><!--372.png--><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 315]</span>
It is said to be one of the liveliest of its tribe, and to be almost constantly
in motion. It is fond of secluded places, and is equally common in the thick
canebrakes, both of the high and the low lands, and in the tangled undergrowth
of impenetrable swamps. It has a peculiarly graceful manner of
closing and opening its broad tail, that at once distinguishes it from every
other bird, as it gambols from tree to tree, now in sight, and now hid from
the eye, but ever within hearing.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon adds that its call-note so closely resembles that of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spiza ciris</i> that it requires a practised ear to distinguish them. But its song
is very different. This consists of three notes, and is loud, lively, and pleasing.
This song is said to be made of sounds resembling the syllables <i class="birdcall">weet,
weet, weetēē</i>. Extremely vocal in the early spring, it becomes nearly silent
as soon as its brood is hatched. It resumes its song when its mate is again
sitting on her eggs, as they have more than one brood in a season.</p>

<p>They are described as expert flycatchers, full of activity and spirit, flying
swiftly after their insect prey; and catching the greater part on the wing.
Their flight is low, gliding, and often protracted.</p>

<p>Mr. Bachman narrates a striking instance of its courage and conjugal devotion.
While a pair of these Warblers were constructing a nest, a Sharp-shinned
Hawk pounced upon and bore off the female. The male followed
close after the Hawk, flying within a few inches and darting at him in all
directions, and so continued until quite out of sight.</p>

<p>Wilson states that it builds a very neat and compact nest, generally in the
fork of a small bush. It is formed of moss and flaxen fibres of plants, and
lined with hair or feathers. The eggs, five in number, he describes as of a
grayish-white, with red spots at the larger end. He noticed its arrival at
Savannah as early as the 20th of March. Mr. Audubon adds that these
nests are always placed in low situations, a few feet from the ground.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Gerhardt, of Varnell’s Station, Georgia, informed me, by letter,
that the Hooded Warbler deposits her eggs about the middle of May,
laying four. The nest is not unlike that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spiza cyanea</i>, but is larger.
It is constructed of dry leaves and coarse grass on the outside, and within
of dry pine-needles, interwoven with long yellow grasses and sometimes with
horsehair. They are built, for the most part, in the neighborhood of brooks
and creeks, in oak bushes, four or five feet from the ground. The female
sits so closely, and is so fearless, that Dr. Gerhardt states he has sometimes
nearly caught her in his hand.</p>

<p>In another letter Dr. Gerhardt describes a nest of this species as measuring
three inches in height, three in external diameter, and an inch and a
quarter in the depth of its cavity. Externally it was built of dry leaves and
coarse grasses, lined inside with horsehair, fine leaves of pine, and dry slender
grasses. It was constructed on a small oak growing in low bottom-land, and
was three feet from the ground. The complement of eggs is four.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway states that this species is a common summer resident in the
<!--373.png--><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 316]</span>
bottom-lands along the Lower Wabash, in Southern Illinois, inhabiting the
cane-brakes and the margins of bushy swamps.</p>

<p>The eggs of this Warbler are oval in shape, with one end quite pointed.
They measure .70 by .50 of an inch. Their ground-color is a beautiful bright
white, when the egg is fresh, strongly tinged with flesh-color. The spots are
of a fine red, with a few markings of a subdued purple.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern United States.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> All that is known in regard to this species we receive from
Wilson and Audubon, and there is a decided discrepancy in their several
statements. Wilson states that his figure was taken from a young male
shot on the 24th of April, but in what locality he does not mention. He
adds that he afterwards shot several individuals in various parts of New
Jersey, particularly in swamps. He found these in June, and has no doubt
they breed there.</p>

<p>Audubon claims that Wilson’s drawing was a copy from his own of a bird
shot by him in Kentucky on the margin of a pond. He throws a doubt as
to the correctness of Wilson’s statement that they have been found in New
Jersey, as no one else has ever met with any there. That may be, however,
and Wilson’s statement yet be correct. The same argument carried out would
reject the very existence of the bird itself, as no well-authenticated records
of its occurrence since then can be found. They are at least too doubtful
to be received as unquestionable until the genuine bird can be produced. Mr.
Nuttall, it is true, states that Mr. Charles Pickering obtained a specimen of
this bird many years ago, near Salem, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, and that he had himself also
seen it in the same State, at the approach of winter. In the fall of 1836,
when the writer resided in Roxbury, a cat caught and brought into the
house a small Flycatcher, which was supposed to be of this species. It was
given to Mr. Audubon, who assented to its correct identification, but afterwards
made no mention of it. The presumption, therefore, is that we may
have been mistaken.</p>

<p><!--374.png--><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 317]</span>
In regard to its habits, Wilson represents it as “remarkably active, running,
climbing, and darting about among the opening buds and blossoms with
extraordinary agility.” Audubon states that in its habits it is closely allied
with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pusillus</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mitratus</i>, being fond of low thick coverts in swamps
and by the margin of pools. He also attributes to it a song of rather pleasing
notes, enunciated at regular intervals, loud enough to be heard at the distance
of sixty yards. These peculiarities seem to separate it from the true
Flycatchers and to place it among the Warblers.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern portions of United States, west to the Snake and Humboldt Rivers;
north to Alaska, south through Eastern Mexico and Guatemala to Costa Rica; Chiriqui
(<span class="sc">Salvin</span>).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Wilson’s Black-Cap is found throughout the United States from
ocean to ocean, and as far to the north as Alaska and the Arctic shores,
where, however, it is not common. Mr. Dall shot a specimen, May 30, on the
Yukon River, where it was breeding. Mr. Bischoff obtained others with nests
and eggs at Sitka, and afterwards found it more abundant at Kodiak. On the
Pacific coast Dr. Suckley found it very abundant in the neighborhood of Fort
Steilacoom, where it frequented thickets and small scrub-oak groves, in its
habits resembling the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Helminthophaga celata</i>, flitting about among the dense
foliage of bushes and low trees in a busy, restless manner. He describes its
cry as a short <i class="birdcall">chit-chat</i> call. In California, Dr. Cooper notes their first arrival
early in May, and states that they migrate along the coast, up at least to
the Straits of Fuca. At Santa Cruz he noted their arrival, in 1866, about
the 20th of April. They were then gathering materials for a nest, the male
bird singing merrily during his employment. As they have been observed
in Oregon as early as this, it has been conjectured that some may remain all
winter among the dense shrubbery of the forests.</p>

<p><!--375.png--><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 318]</span>
This bird winters in large numbers in Central America, where it is apparently
very generally distributed. Mr. Salvin found it very common at Duenas.
It was taken at Totontepec, among the mountains of Oaxaca, Mexico,
by Mr. Boucard.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found it very common during the summer and autumn
months among the willows of the fertile river valleys, and among the rank
shrubbery bordering upon the streams of the cañons of the higher interior
range of mountains. It was found in similar situations with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroica
æstiva</i>, but it was much more numerous. During September it was most
abundant among the thickets and copses of the East Humboldt Mountains,
and in Ruby Valley, at all altitudes, frequenting the bushes along the streams,
from their sources in the snow to the valleys.</p>

<p>Wilson first met with and described this species from specimens obtained
in Delaware and New Jersey. He regarded it as an inhabitant of the swamps
of the Southern States, and characterized its song as “a sharp, squeaking
note, in no wise musical.” It is said by him to leave the Southern States in
October.</p>

<p>Audubon states that it is never found in the Southern States in the summer
months, but passes rapidly through them on its way to the northern districts,
where it breeds, reaching Labrador early in June and returning by the
middle of August. He describes it as having all the habits of a true Flycatcher,
feeding on small insects, which it catches on the wing, snapping its
bill with a sharp clicking sound. It frequents the borders of lakes and
streams fringed with low bushes.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall observed this species in Oregon, where it arrived early in May.
He calls it a “little cheerful songster, the very counterpart of our brilliant
and cheerful Yellow-Bird.” Their song he describes as like <i class="birdcall">’tsh-’tsh-’tsh-tshea</i>.
Their call is brief, and not so loud. It appeared familiar and unsuspicious,
kept in bushes busily collecting its insect fare, and only varied its employment
by an occasional and earnest warble. By the 12th of May some were
already feeding their full-fledged young. Yet on the 16th of the same month
he found a nest containing four eggs with incubation only just commenced.
This nest was in a branch of a small service-bush, laid very adroitly, as to
concealment, upon a mass of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Usnea</i>. It was built chiefly of hypnum mosses,
with a thick lining of dry, wiry, slender grasses. The female, when approached,
slipped off the nest, and ran along the ground like a mouse. The
eggs were very similar to those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroica æstiva</i>, with spots of a pale
olive-brown, confluent at the greater end.</p>

<p>A nest found by Audubon in Labrador was placed on the extremity of a
small horizontal branch, among the thick foliage of a dwarf fir, a few feet
from the ground and in the very centre of a thicket. It was made of bits of
dry mosses and delicate pine twigs, agglutinated together and to the branches
and leaves around it, from which it was suspended. It was lined with fine
vegetable fibres. The diameter of the nest was three and a half and the
<!--376.png--><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 319]</span>
depth one and a half inches. He describes the eggs, which were four, as
white; spotted with reddish and brown dots, the markings being principally
around the larger end, forming a circle, leaving the extremity plain.</p>

<p>In this instance the parents showed much uneasiness at the approach of
intruders, moving about among the twigs, snapping their bills, and uttering
a plaintive note. In Newfoundland these birds had already begun to migrate
on the 20th of August. He met with them in considerable numbers
in Northern Maine in October, 1832. Mr. Turnbull mentions it as a rather
abundant bird of Eastern Pennsylvania, appearing there early in May, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
transitu</i>, and again in October.</p>

<p>Mr. T. M. Trippe has observed this species at Orange, <abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr>, from the 19th
to the 30th of May. It is said to keep low down in the trees, and is fond
of haunting thickets and open brush fields. Occasionally he has heard it
utter a loud chattering song, which it repeats at short intervals.</p>

<p>A nest of this species from Fort Yukon (<abbr title="Smithsonian Collection">Smith. Coll.</abbr>, 13,346), obtained
May 20, by Mr. McDougal, contained four eggs. These varied from .60 to
.63 of an inch in length, and from .45 to .49 in breadth. They were obovate
in shape, their ground-color was a pure white; this was finely sprinkled
round the larger end with brownish-red and lilac. No mention is made of
the position of the nest, but it is probable this bird builds on the ground.</p>

Whole Eastern Province of United States, west to the Missouri; north to Lake
Winnipeg; Eastern Mexico to Guatemala, and south to Bogota and Ecuador (<span class="sc">Sclater</span>).
Not noted from West Indies.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This is a migratory species, abundant during its passage, in
most of the Atlantic States. It breeds, though not abundantly, in New
York and Massachusetts, and in the regions north of latitude 42<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. How far
northward it is found is not well ascertained, probably as far, however, as the
wooded country extends. It was met with on Winnepeg River, by Mr. Kennicott,
the second of June. It winters in Central and in Northern South
America, having been procured at Bogota, in Guatemala, and in Costa Rica,
in large numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon states that he found this bird breeding in the mountainous
regions of Pennsylvania, and afterwards in Maine, New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia, Newfoundland, and Labrador. Although he describes with some minuteness
its nests, yet his description of their position and structure is so
entirely different in all respects from those that have been found in Massachusetts,
that I am constrained to believe he has been mistaken in his identifications,
and that those he supposed to belong to this species were really
the nests of a different bird.</p>

<p>“In Vermont,” Mr. Charles S. Paine, of Randolph, informs me, “the Canada
Flycatcher is a summer visitant, and is first seen about the 18th of May.
They do not spread themselves over the woods, like most of our small fly-catching
birds, but keep near the borders, where there is a low growth of
bushes, and where they may be heard throughout the day singing their regular
<!--378.png--><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 321]</span>
chant. A few pairs may occasionally be found in the same neighborhood.
At other times only a single pair can be found in quite a wide extent of territory
of similar character. They build their nests, as well as I can judge,
about the first of June, as the young are hatched out and on the wing about
the last of that month, or the first of July. I have never found a nest, but
I think they are built on the ground. They are silent after the first of July,
and are rarely to be seen after that period.” The song of this bird is a very
pleasing one, though heard but seldom, and only in a few localities in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Near Washington Dr. Coues found the Canada Flycatcher only a spring
and autumnal visitant, at which seasons they were abundant. They frequented
high open woods, and kept mostly in the lower branches of the trees,
and also in the more open undergrowth of marshy places. They arrive the
last week in April and remain about two weeks, arriving in fall the first
week in September, and remaining until the last of that month.</p>

<p>The first well-identified nest of this bird that came to my knowledge was
obtained in Lynn, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, by Mr. George O. Welch, in June, 1856. It was
built in a tussock of grass, in swampy woods, concealed by the surrounding
rank vegetation, in the midst of which it was placed. It was constructed
entirely of pine-needles and a few fragments of decayed leaves, grapevine
bark, fine stems, and rootlets. These were so loosely interwoven that the
nest could not be removed without great care to keep its several portions
together. Its diameter was three and a half inches, and it was very nearly
flat. Its greatest depth, at the centre of its depression, was hardly half an
inch. It contained four young, and an unhatched egg.</p>

<p>Another nest found in June, 1864, by the same observing naturalist, was also
obtained in the neighborhood. This was built in a tussock of meadow-grass,
in the midst of a small boggy piece of swamp, in which were a few scattered
trees and bushes. The ground was so marshy that it could be crossed only
with difficulty, and by stepping from one tussock of reedy herbage to another.
In the centre of one of these bunches the nest was concealed. It measures
six inches in its larger diameter, and has a height of two and a quarter
inches. The cavity of this nest is two and three quarters inches wide,
and one and three quarters deep. It is very strongly constructed of pine-needles,
interwoven with fine strips of bark, dry deciduous leaves, stems of dry
grasses, sedges, etc. The whole is firmly and compactly interwoven with and
strengthened around the rim of the cavity by strong, wiry, and fibrous roots.
The nest is very carefully and elaborately lined with the black fibrous roots
of some plant. The eggs, which were five in number, measure .72 of an inch
in length by .56 in breadth. Their ground-color is a clear and brilliant
white, and this is beautifully marked with dots and small blotches of blended
brown, purple, and violet, varying in shades and tints, and grouped in a
wreath around the larger end.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The so-called Redstart has an extended distribution from the
Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains, and
from Florida to high northern latitudes,
having been found breeding at Fort
Simpson by Mr. Ross, and at Fort
Resolution by Mr. Kennicott and Mr.
Lockhart. It is generally abundant in
suitable localities, and probably breeds
wherever found north of the Potomac.
It winters in large numbers in Guatemala
and in other parts of Central
America, as well as in the West Indies.
It is common in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix in the spring,
and is especially seen about houses, according to Newton. It remains
there until the end of April.</p>

<p>Richardson found this species abundant on the Saskatchewan, as far to the
north as the fifty-eighth parallel. It appeared there the last of May, and
left early in September. He found it frequenting moist, shady lands, flitting
about among the moss-grown and twisted stems of the tall willows that
skirt the marshes. It was easily recognized by the red lining of its wings
as it flitted through the gloomy shades in pursuit of mosquitoes and other
winged insects.</p>

<p>Among the memoranda of the late Mr. Kennicott, we find two to the effect
that on the 26th of May he found both males and females of this species
common near Rainy Lake, and that on the 6th of June he also observed
these birds near Lake Winnepeg. June 14, at Fort Resolution, he obtained
a female Redstart with nest and four eggs. The nest was built in the fork
of a willow, in a thick but low wood of alder and willow. It was entirely
unprotected by leaves or branches. The female was taken on the nest.</p>

<p>The Newtons found this a very common species in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix, in the spring
<!--383.png--><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 324]</span>
of the year, and it was especially seen about houses. For about a week, at
the end of April, 1857, they were extremely numerous. On their return from
their summer quarters, they were first observed September 6. Mr. Taylor
also mentions them as common in Trinidad. Mr. Ridgway found it a common
species among the willow thickets of the river valleys, west as far as
the Great Salt Lake.</p>

<p>This species, in its spring and autumnal migrations, is abundant in Louisiana
and Texas, as well as in the Gulf States. Wilson speaks of meeting
with it in the then “Mississippi Territory.” Audubon gives it as abundant
in Louisiana, and Nuttall as found throughout Louisiana and Arkansas into
Mexico. Mr. Dresser also mentions it as very common near San Antonio in
the spring and autumn, arriving on the Medina the 27th of April.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues says that the Redstart near Washington is chiefly a spring and
autumnal visitant, and but very few remain to breed. In the spring it is
very abundant from April 25 to May 20, and in the fall from the 1st to the
20th of September, in all woody and swampy situations. He found it in
the habit of running along slender twigs, sideways, and having a note very
similar to that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. œstiva</i>.</p>

<p>Although placed among the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oscines</i>, where, as an excellent singer, it clearly
has a good right to be classed, it is yet also a true Flycatcher in habits and
manners. It is a lively, active bird, ever on the wing, and continually in
pursuit of insects. In this pursuit it never awaits the approach of its prey,
but, espying them at a distance, darts with great velocity in pursuit, and the
continued clicks of its bill attest the rapidity and frequency with which it
will overtake and catch insect after insect. Even when lamenting the loss
of a part of its brood, and flying around with cries of distress, the sight of
passing insects is a temptation not to be resisted, and the parent bird will
stop her lamentations to catch small flies.</p>

<p>Its notes are a varied twitter, rather than a song, a repetition of two simple
notes, uttered every few seconds as it seeks its prey, flying among the thick
foliage usually in dense groves. Its common habit is to glide along a branch,
between its smaller twigs, at times darting forth into more open spaces in
quest of insects it has espied.</p>

<p>Their nests are usually, though not always, built in a low branch, eight or
ten feet from the ground, in the midst of a thick grove. I have known it
to build in an open field and in close proximity to a dwelling. It keeps to
groves and thickets, and frequents moist places rather than dry, evidently
because of the greater abundance of insects, and not because of timid or
retiring habits. It is indeed far from being timid, and will permit a near
approach without any exhibitions of uneasiness. When its nest is visited,
the male bird manifests great disturbance, and flies back and forth around the
head of the intruder with cries of distress. The female is far less demonstrative,
and even when her nest is despoiled before her eyes is quite moderate
in the expression of her grief.</p>

<p><!--384.png--><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 325]</span>
Its flight is graceful, easy, and rapid, varied by circumstances as it glides
in its intricate course among small interlacing branches, or darts rapidly forth
into more open space. As it moves, it is continually opening out, closing, or
flirting from side to side its conspicuous tail, the white spots in its expanded
feathers constantly appearing and disappearing.</p>

<p>In the construction of the nest there is a general uniformity of character,
although the materials differ and the localities are far apart. They are never
pendent, but are placed among three or more small upright branches, around
which it is firmly woven with vegetable flax-like fibres. A nest obtained in
Lynn, by Mr. George O. Welch (<abbr title="Smithsonian Institution">S. I.</abbr> 3,778), in June, measures two inches
in height by three in diameter. It is a small, compact, and homogeneous
nest, composed almost entirely of shreds of savin-bark intermixed with soft
vegetable wool. Within are loosely intertwined minute vegetable fibres and
strips of bark, and a lining of horsehair, fine pine leaves, and dry grasses.
The nest contained four eggs. Another nest found in Grand Menan, June
24, 1851, was very similar in size, structure, and materials. It was in the
centre of a thick, swampy thicket, five feet from the ground, and contained
five eggs.</p>

<p>Another nest of this bird, obtained in Lynn by Mr. Welch, is only a
reconstruction of a nest begun by a pair of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroica œstiva</i>, and either
abandoned by them, or from which they had been driven. Above the original
nest of the Warbler the Redstarts had constructed their own. The base
is composed of the downy covering of the under sides of the leaves of ferns,
mixed with a few herbaceous stems and leaves. Within this was built an
entirely distinct nest, composed of long and slender strips of bark, pine-needles,
and stems of grasses. These are firmly and elaborately interwoven
together.</p>

<p>A nest found in Hingham, built in a tree in an open space near a dwelling,
was seven feet from the ground, and of the usual size and shape. In
this the more usual strips of bark were replaced by hempen fibres of vegetables,
thistle-down, bits of newspaper, and other fragments. Within is a
strong lining of hair and fine stems of grasses. In this nest there were two
young, about half fledged, and two eggs nearly fresh. The latter were taken,
the female parent being present and making only a very slight protest,
stopping, from time to time, to catch insects.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Redstart vary considerably in their size and in their general
appearance, but resemble somewhat those of the common Summer
Yellow-Bird. They vary in length from .55 to .68 of an inch, and in their
breadth from .45 to .53. Their ground-color is a grayish-white, blotched
and clotted with purple, lilac, and brown.</p>

<h2><span class="sc">Family</span> <b class="birdname">HIRUNDINIDÆ</b>.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Swallows.</span></h2>
<!--I AM HERE-->
<p class="small"><abbr title="Characteristics"><span class="sc">Char.</span></abbr> Bill short, triangular, very broad at base (nearly as wide as long) and much depressed,
narrowing rapidly to a compressed, notched tip; mouth opening nearly to the
eyes. Primaries nine, graduating rapidly less from the exterior one; tail-feathers twelve.
Feet weak; tarsi scutellate, shorter than middle toe and claw. Number of joints in toes
normal; basal joint of middle toe partially or entirely adherent to lateral toes. Wings
long, falcate. Tail forked. Eyes small. Plumage compact, usually lustrous. All the
American species with a white patch on the sides under the wing, and with the irids
hazel or brown.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hirundinidæ</i> form a very well marked group of birds easily distinguished
from all others. They exhibit a close resemblance, in external appearance
and habits, to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cypselidæ</i>; from which, apart from the internal
structure, they are readily distinguished by the possession of nine, instead of
ten primaries; twelve, instead of ten tail-feathers; scutellate tarsi, toes with
normal number of joints (1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, exclusive of ungual
phalanges), instead of a different proportion; differently shaped nostrils, etc.
In both families the wings are developed to an extraordinary degree; the
outer primary nearly twice or more than twice the length of the inner, and
enabling its possessor to sustain flight almost indefinitely. The relations of
the family among the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oscines</i> appear closest to the Old World <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Muscicapidæ</i>.</p>

<p>In comparing the wings of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hirundinidæ</i> with those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cypselidæ</i>
we readily notice one of the essential characters of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oscines</i>, namely, that
the greater wing-coverts hide only half or less than half of the secondary
quills, instead of reaching much beyond their middle, or nearly to the end.
(See Sundevall, <abbr lang="sv" xml:lang="sv" title="Ornithologiskt System">Ornith. Syst.</abbr>)</p>

<p>The precise character of scutellation of tarsus is somewhat difficult to
make out, owing to a tendency to fusion of the plates, although not essentially
different from most <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oscines</i>. There is a series of scutellæ along the
anterior face of the tarsus, and a longitudinal plate on each side, meeting, but
not coalescing, behind. The anterior scutellæ sometimes appear to fuse into
the outer lateral plate; or sometimes the latter is more or less subdivided;
the inner plate is generally more distinct from the anterior scutellæ, and
usually entire, except perhaps at the lower extremity.</p>

crissum, but all the feathers always with dusky shafts, and more or less clouded with gray
centrally, even though fading into whitish to the edges. This is particularly appreciable in
the longer crissal feathers. The edges of the dark feathers of throat and jugulum are
usually paler, imparting somewhat of a lunulated appearance, their centres sometimes
considerably darker, causing an appearance of obsolete spots. There is a tendency to a
grayish collar on sides of neck, and generally traceable to the nape; this, in one specimen
(5,492) from California, being hoary gray, the forehead similar.</p>

<p>An adult female (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 61,361, G. A. Boardman) from Lake Harney, Florida,
is so unlike all other specimens in the collection as to almost warrant our
considering it as representing a distinct local race. It differs from females
and young males of all the other races (except <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">elegans</i>, from which it differs
in other striking particulars) in the following respects: Above, the lustrous
steel-blue is uninterrupted, the forehead and nape being uniform with the
other portions; beneath, dark smoky-gray, inclining to whitish on the middle
of the abdomen; the jugulum and crissum have a faint gloss of steel-blue,
the feathers of the latter bordered
with grayish-white. The chief difference
from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">elegans</i> is in lacking the
conspicuous grayish-white border to
the feathers of the whole lower part,
the surface being uniform instead of
conspicuously squamated. Wing, 5.60;
tail, 3.00; fork of tail, .80 deep.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Purple Martin is emphatically
a bird common to the whole
of North America. It breeds from
Florida to high northern latitudes,
and from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
It is very abundant in Florida, as it
is in various other parts of the country
farther north, and the large flocks of migrating birds of this species which
pass through Eastern Massachusetts the last of September attest its equal
abundance north of the latter State. It occurs in Bermuda, is resident in the
<!--390.png--><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 331]</span>
alpine regions of Mexico, and is also found at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas. Accidental
specimens have been detected in England and in Ireland. It is abundant
on the Saskatchewan. Burmeister states that this species is common in the
vicinity of Rio de Janeiro, and that it is distributed in moderate abundance
through the whole of tropical South America. Von Pelzeln also cites it as
occurring on the Rio Negro and at Manaqueri through the three winter
months, nesting in old buildings and in holes in the rocks. It is, however,
quite possible that they refer to an allied but distinct species.</p>

<p>In a wild state the natural resort of this species, for nesting and shelter,
was to hollow trees and crevasses in rocks. The introduction of civilized
life, and with it of other safer and more convenient places, better adapted to
their wants, has wrought an entire change in its habits. It is now very
rarely known to resort to a hollow tree, though it will do so where better
provision is not to be had. Comfortable and convenient boxes, of various
devices, in our cities and large towns, attract them to build in small communities
around the dwellings of man, where their social, familiar, and confiding
disposition make them general favorites. There they find abundance of insect
food, and repay their benefactors by the destruction of numerous injurious
and noxious kinds, and there, too, they are also comparatively safe from
their own enemies. These conveniences vary from the elegant martin-houses
that adorn private grounds in our Eastern cities to the ruder gourds
and calabashes which are said to be frequently placed near the humbler
cabins of the Southern negroes. In Washington the columns of the public
buildings, and the eaves and sheltered portions of the piazzas, afford a convenient
protection to large numbers around the Patent Office and the Post-Office
buildings.</p>

<p>The abundance of this species varies in different parts of the country, from
causes not always apparent. In the vicinity of Boston it is quite unusual,
though said to have been, forty years since, quite common. There their
places are taken by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. bicolor</i>, who occupy almost exclusively the martin-houses,
and very rarely build in hollow trees.</p>

<p>Sir John Richardson states that it arrives within the Arctic Circle earlier
than any other of its family. It made its first appearance at Great Bear
Lake as early as the 17th of May, when the ground was covered with snow,
and the rivers and lakes were all icebound.</p>

<p>In the Southern States it is said to raise three broods in a season; in its
more northern distribution it raises but one. Their early migrations expose
the Martins to severe exposure and suffering from changes of weather, in
which large numbers have been known to perish. An occurrence of this
kind is said to have taken place in Eastern Massachusetts, where nearly all
the birds of this species were destroyed, and where to this day their places
have never been supplied.</p>

<p>Within its selected compartment the Martin prepares a loose and irregular
nest. This is composed of various materials, such as fine dry leaves, straws,
<!--391.png--><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 332]</span>
stems of grasses, fine twigs, bits of string, rags, etc. These are carelessly
thrown together, and the whole is usually warmly lined with feathers or
other soft materials. This nest is occupied year after year by the same pair,
but with each new brood the nest is thoroughly repaired, and often increased
in size by the accumulation of new materials.</p>

<p>The Martins do not winter in the United States, but enter the extreme
Southern portions early in February. Audubon states that they arrive often
in prodigious flocks. On the Ohio their advent is about the 15th of March,
and in Missouri, Ohio, and Pennsylvania about the 10th of April. About
Boston their appearance is from the 25th of April to the middle of May.
Mr. Audubon states that they all return to the Southern States about the
20th of August, but this is hardly correct. Their departure varies very much
with the season. In the fall of 1870 they were to be found in large flocks,
slowly moving southward, but often remaining several days at a time at the
same place, and then proceeding to their next halt. Their favorite places for
such stops are usually a high and uninhabited hillside near the sea.</p>

<p>The Martin is a bold and courageous bird, prompt to meet and repel dangers,
especially when threatened by winged enemies, never hesitating to attack
and drive them away from its neighborhood. It is therefore a valuable
protection to the barnyard. Its food is the larger kinds of insects, especially
beetles, in destroying which it again does good service to the husbandman.
The song of the Martin is a succession of twitters, which, without being
musical, are far from being unpleasant; they begin with the earliest dawn,
and during the earlier periods of incubation are almost incessantly repeated.
The eggs of the Purple Martin measure .94 of an inch in length by .79 in
breadth. They are of an oblong-oval shape, are pointed at one end, are of
a uniform creamy-white, and are never spotted. They are quite uniform
in size and shape. Eggs from Florida are proportionally smaller than those
from the Northern States.</p>

<p class="small"><i class="sex">Female</i> (17,730, Monte Verde, Cuba, May 2; C. Wright). Above steel-blue, less glossy

laterally and beneath, with jugulum and sides, uniform brownish-gray (without darker
shafts or lighter borders to feathers, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subis</i>); whole abdomen, anal region, and crissum
snowy-white, including the shafts. Wing, 5.40; tail, 2.80; fork of tail, .70 deep.</p>

<p class="small"><i class="age">Young male</i> (10,368, Cape Florida, May 18, 1858; G. Wurdemann). Similar to the
female, but the steel-blue above more brilliant and continuous, the forehead and wings
being nearly as lustrous as the back; throat and jugulum mixed with steel-blue feathers,
and crissum with some feathers of steel-blue bordered with whitish. Wing. 5.40; tail,
2.90; fork of tail, .80 deep.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Cuba, and Florida Keys? (Perhaps Bahamas.)</p>

<p>This species has a close external resemblance to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. subis</i>, for which it has
usually been mistaken. It is of nearly the same size, but the feet are disproportionately
smaller and weaker; while the wings are shorter, the tail is as
long and more deeply forked; the feathers considerably narrower, and more
attenuated (the outer .40 wide, instead of .46). The colors above are more
brilliant, and extend more over the greater wing-coverts and lining of wings,
while the quills and tail-feathers have a richer gloss of purplish, changing
to greenish. An apparently good diagnostic feature is the concealed pure
white of the feathers about the anal regions, replaced in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subis</i> by grayish,
rarely approximating to whitish.</p>

<p>A <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Progne</i> collected by Mr. Wright, at Monte Verde, is duller in color than
that from Remedios, but has still more concealed white below, in the median
portion, not only of the anal feathers, but of those of the entire crissum and
of the belly. A female bird, which I presume to be the same species, can
scarcely be distinguished from the female of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominicensis</i>, except in the
brownish shafts of the longer crissal feathers, and an almost imperceptible
tinge of brownish in the webs of the same feathers. It is almost exactly
like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. leucogaster</i> of Mexico and Central America.</p>

<p>This species is included in the North American fauna in consequence of
the capture of a specimen (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 10,368 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr> <abbr class="juvenile" title="juvenile">juv.</abbr>, May 18, 1858) at Cape Florida,
which is with scarcely a doubt referable to it. This specimen is a
young male in its second year, so that it is difficult to ascertain positively
its relationship to the two allied species; but as it agrees perfectly in its proportions
with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cryptoleuca</i>, and its plumage differs from the corresponding one
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subis</i> in essential respects, we have little hesitation in referring it to the
former.</p>

<p>Nothing distinctive is recorded as to the habits of this bird.</p>

<p>There is no difference between the sexes, but the young bird is very different
from the adult in the following particulars: the steel-blue above
is replaced by a lustreless dusky-brown, the feathers (except on head)
being margined with a creamy tint; the neck merely tinged with rufous;
the throat has only a dusky suffusion, and the chin is much mixed with
white; the frontal patch is obsolete.</p>

<p>A closely allied species from Mexico, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. swainsoni</i> (see Baird, <abbr title="Review">Rev.</abbr> Am.

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The early history of the Cliff Swallow must always remain involved
in some obscurity, so far as concerns its numbers and distribution
before the first settlement of the country, and even down to the early portion
of the present century. Its existence was unknown to Mr. Wilson, and it
was unknown to other naturalists until obtained by Say, in Long’s expedition
to the Rocky Mountains in 1820. It is now known to occur nearly
throughout North America, and to breed from Pennsylvania to the Arctic
regions, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Yet to many parts of the
country it is a new-comer, where, a few years since, it was entirely unknown.
It seems to be probable that at first this species was to be found
only in certain localities that offered favorable places whereon to construct
their nests. Where high limestone cliffs abound, these birds may have
always occurred, although escaping observation.</p>

<p>In the same year that Long discovered this species among the Rocky
Mountains (1820), Sir John Franklin’s party also met with it between the
Cumberland House and Fort Enterprise, and on the banks of Point Lake, in
latitude 65<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. In June, 1825, a number of these birds made their first appearance
at Fort Chippewyan, and built their nests under the eaves of the
house. This fort had then existed many years, and trading-posts had been
in existence a century and a half, and yet this was the first instance of its
<!--395.png--><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 336]</span>
placing itself under the protection of man throughout that wide extent of
territory. Mr. Audubon met with this species at Henderson, on the Ohio, in
1815. Two years later he found a colony breeding in Newport, <abbr title="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr>, which
dated back to the same year. Several other colonies in that neighborhood
also first appeared in the same year. In 1837 I received their eggs from
Coventry, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, at which time they were a new species to me. They were
there known as the “Eave Swallow,” and the time of their first appearance
could not be determined. I first met with them in 1839, at Jaffrey, <abbr title="New Hampshire">N. H.</abbr>,
where they had made their first appearance the year before, and were not
then known to be anywhere else in that vicinity. The same year I afterwards
found them in Burlington, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, where they had been known only for
three years. When or where they first appeared in Massachusetts is not
known. I first observed a large colony of them in Attleborough in 1842.
Its size indicated the existence of these birds in that place for several years.
The same year they also appeared, apparently for the first time, in Boston,
Hingham, and in other places in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>In 1824, De Witt Clinton read a paper to the New York Lyceum, stating
that he had met with these birds at Whitehall, <abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr>, at the southern end of
Lake Champlain, in 1817, about the time of their first appearance on the
Ohio; and <abbr title="Review">Rev.</abbr> Zadock Thompson met with them in Randolph, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, at about
the same period. General Dearborn noticed them for the first time in Winthrop,
<abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>, in 1830. They first appeared at Carlisle, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>, in 1841.</p>

<p>Professor Verrill discovered, in 1861, a large colony of these birds breeding
on the high limestone cliffs of Anticosti, apparently in their original condition,
and entirely removed from the influences of man. This suggested an
inquiry as to their early presence in Northeastern America. From the information
he received, he was led to conclude that this Swallow was known
to certain parts of Maine earlier than its first discovery anywhere in the
West. Whether these birds were indigenous to the West or not cannot now
be determined. That they were discovered there only so recently as 1820
proves nothing. We only know that in certain localities&mdash;such as Rock
River on the Mississippi, and at Anticosti on the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence&mdash;their occurrence
in large numbers in their former normal condition of independence
suggests in either locality an equally remote beginning. It is possible, and
even probable, that in favorable localities in various parts of the country they
existed in isolated colonies. The settlement of the country, and the multiplication
of convenient, sheltered, and safe places for their nests, gradually
wrought a change in their habits, and greatly multiplied their numbers. At
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen, <abbr title="New Brunswick">N. B.</abbr>, and in that neighborhood, Mr. Boardman found this
species as abundant in 1828 as they have been at any time since. They were
then very plentiful under the eaves of several old barns in that part of the
country. Yet twelve years afterward they were entirely unknown on the
lower Kennebeck.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found this to be an abundant species in California, on the
<!--396.png--><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 337]</span>
coast, where they breed on the cliffs, and have all the appearance of being
indigenous. They appear at San Diego as early as March 15, a week before
the Barn Swallow, and do not leave until October. They build even in the
noisy streets of San Francisco. Dr. Cooper observed them catching young
grasshoppers, which is certainly unusual food for Swallows, and one that has
proved fatal to young Barn Swallows when fed to the latter in confinement.
At Santa Cruz they bred as early as April 12, and had second broods July 5.</p>

<p>The nests of this Swallow, when built on the side of a cliff or in any exposed
position, are constructed in the shape of a retort, the larger portion
adhering to the wall, arched over at the top and projecting in front, with a
covered passage-way opening at the bottom. The normal original nest, in a
state of nature, is an elaborate and remarkably ingenious structure, sheltering
its inmates from the weather and from their many enemies. Since they
have sought the shelter of man and built under the eaves of barns and houses,
the old style of their nests has been greatly changed, and the retort-like shape
has nearly disappeared.</p>

<p>In building and in repairing their nests they work with great industry, and
often complete their task with wonderful celerity. Where they exist in a
large colony, it is not an uncommon thing to see several birds at work upon
the same nest,&mdash;one bird, apparently the female owner, always assisting and
directing the whole. After the work of construction has gone so far as to
permit the occupation of the nest, it is often to be observed that the task of
completing and improving the structure is kept up by the male. In a large
colony of these Swallows, whose nests were built under the projecting roof
of a barn in a small island in the Bay of Fundy, every nest was as open as are
those of the Barn Swallow. These birds had been encouraged to build by
the owner, and boards had been placed above and below their nests, of which
they at once took advantage to build an unusual nest. These nests are
made of various kinds of adhesive earth and mud. They are neatly and
warmly lined with fine dry grasses and leaves, intermingled with feathers,
wool, and other soft, warm substances. It has been thought that the mud
of which these nests are composed is agglutinated by the saliva of the
birds; but of this I have never been able to detect any evidence in the nests
themselves, the crumbling nature of which when dry is against this supposition;
and the birds themselves are often to be seen about puddles of water,
apparently gathering materials.</p>

<p>When the nests of a large colony are invaded, the birds manifest great uneasiness,
collecting in a swarm over the head of the intruder, wheeling around
in circles, uttering loud outcries, and even flying close to his head, as if to
attack him, with loud snapping of the bills.</p>

<p>The song of this Swallow is an unmusical creak, rather than a twitter,
frequent rather than loud, and occasionally harsh, yet so earnest and genial
in its expression that its effect is far from being unpleasant.</p>

<p>The ground-color of their eggs is white, and they are marked with dots,
<!--397.png--><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 338]</span>
blotches, and points of reddish-brown. These markings vary greatly in size,
number, and distribution. They are usually chiefly about the larger end.
In shape they are usually less elongated than those of the Barn Swallow, and
their markings are larger. This is not, however, invariable, and the two
kinds are not always distinguishable. In length they vary from .875 of an
inch to .75, and their average breadth is .60.</p>

<p>In young birds, the frontal chestnut band is maller and less distinct.</p>

<p>It is still a question whether a South American resident species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. erythrogaster</i>)
is identical or not. The only two specimens of the latter (21,007
and 21,008, Vermejo, <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr>, 1860; C. Wood) have a very much less violaceous
upper plumage than North American examples, the blue above having
even a greenish tinge. They are moulting, unfortunately, so that they cannot
be satisfactorily compared; except in the respect pointed out, however, they
appear to be identical with North American examples.</p>

<p>The European <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. rustica</i> is perfectly distinct, though closely allied. It
differs essentially from the American <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. horreorum</i> in much longer outer

tail-feathers, and in having a very broad, continuous collar of steel-blue
across the jugulum, entirely isolating the chestnut of the throat; the abdomen
appears to be much more whitish than in the American species.</p>

<p>Many specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. horreorum</i> show a continuous collar, but then the
two lateral crescents are but just barely connected. In <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2,191 <abbr title="female symbol">♀</abbr>, Carlisle,
Penn., May, there is an indication of as broad a collar as in the European
species; but the area, though sharply bounded, is not uniformly black, being
much mixed centrally with light rufous.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> No one of all our North American birds is more widely diffused,
more generally abundant, wherever found, or better known, than the graceful
and familiar Barn Swallow. And no one is more universally or more
deservedly a favorite. Found throughout North America from Florida to
Greenland and from ocean to ocean, and breeding nearly throughout the
same wide extent, its distribution is universal. Venturing with a confiding
trust into our crowded cities, and building their elaborate nests in the
porches of the dwellings, as well as entering in greater numbers the barns
and farm-buildings of the agriculturists and placing themselves under
the protection of man, they rarely fail to win for themselves the interest and
good-will they so well deserve. Innocent and blameless in their lives, there
is no evil blended with the many benefits they confer on man. They are his
ever-constant benefactor and friend, and are never known, even indirectly, to
do him any injury. For their daily food, and for that of their offspring,
they destroy the insects that annoy his cattle, injure his fruit-trees, sting
his fruit, or molest his person. Social, affectionate, and kind in their intercourse
with each other; faithful and devoted in the discharge of their conjugal
and parental duties; exemplary, watchful, and tender alike to their own
family and to all their race; sympathizing and benevolent when their fellows
are in any trouble,&mdash;these lovely and beautiful birds are bright examples
to all, in their blameless and useful lives.</p>

<p>This Swallow passes the winter months in Central and South America as
far south as Brazil and Paraguay, and the West Indies, and is found throughout
the year in the Plateau of Mexico. It appears in the Southern States
in March, and in the Central States early in April. In the latter part of this
month it reaches New York and New England, becoming abundant near
Boston about the first of May. Sir John Richardson found them breeding
as far north as latitude 67<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> 30<abbr title="minutes">′</abbr>. They reached Fort Chippewyan, latitude
57<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, as early as the 15th of May, taking possession of their nests. It has
been found throughout Canada and in all the British Provinces, has been
met with in New Mexico, and is common in certain portions of Texas and
the Indian Territory. Dr. Cooper states it to be less abundant on the Pacific
than on the Eastern coast,&mdash;a fact attributable to the lack of suitable places
in which to build. As settlements have multiplied, these birds have gradually
<!--400.png--><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 341]</span>
increased about farms near the coast. In the wild districts they build
in the caves that abound in the bluffs along the sea-shore from San Domingo
to Columbia River. Dr. Suckley found them also moderately abundant
about the basaltic cliffs, near Fort Dalles, Oregon. They are much more
abundant about the coast than farther inland.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found this Swallow a very common species in all the rocky
localities in the vicinity of water, but not so numerous as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lunifrons</i>.</p>

<p>In May it was particularly numerous in the neighborhood of Pyramid
Lake, where its nests were built among the “tufa domes,” attached to the
roofs of the caves. It was seldom that more than one or two pairs were
found together.</p>

<p>In July he found a nest that contained young, in a cave among the limestone
cliffs of the cañons of the East Humboldt Mountains, at an altitude
of about eight thousand feet. Many of their nests were found in May, in
the caves of the tufa rocks, on the shores of Pyramid Lake, as well as on
the islands in the lake.</p>

<p>Mr. Hepburn writes that he found this Swallow widely diffused along the
Pacific coast, as far to the north as Sitka. In California he found it very
local, common near the coast, rare inland. Its earliest appearance is March
26, the great bulk leave in August, and the last stragglers are gone before
the last of September. They breed in caves and crevices of rocks, and also
under the sides of the wooden bridges that span the gullies at San Francisco.
Two broods are hatched in a year. The earliest egg was found on the 30th
of April, but they are usually a fortnight later. The second laying is about
the first of July, and no eggs were found later than the 4th of August. It
is at all times quite common to find nests with fresh eggs close to others
with half-grown young.</p>

<p>Mr. J. K. Lord publishes an interesting account of a visit made by a solitary
pair of Barn Swallows to his party when encamped at Schyakwateen,
in British Columbia. A small shanty, loosely built of poles, and tightly
roofed, was in constant use as a blacksmith’s shop. Early one summer
morning late in June, a pair of Swallows perched on the roof of this shed,
without exhibiting the slightest fear of the noise made by the bellows or the
showers of sparks that flew all around. Presently they entered the house
and carefully examined the roof and its supporting poles, twittering to each
other all the while in the most excited manner. At length the important
question appeared to be settled, and the following day they commenced
building on one of the poles immediately over the anvil. Though the hammer
was constantly passing close to their structure, these birds kept steadily
at their work. In about three days the rough outline of the nest had been
constructed. Curious to see from whence they procured their materials, Mr.
Lord tracked them to the stream where, on its edge, they worked up the
clay and fine sand into a kind of mortar with their beaks. They worked
incessantly, and in a few days their nest was finished, the mud walls having
<!--401.png--><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 342]</span>
finally been warmly lined with soft dry grasses and the feathers and down
of ducks and geese. This trustful pair seemed to know no fear. The
narrator often stood on a log to watch them, with his face so near that
their feathers frequently brushed against it as they toiled at their work.
Soon the nest was completed. Five eggs were laid, which were never left
once uncovered until they were hatched, the female sitting the greater part
of the time. They were fed with great assiduity by the parents, and grew
rapidly. In leaving the nest, two of the young birds fell to the ground, but
were picked up by the blacksmith, and placed with the others on their
roosting-place. A few days’ training taught them the use of their wings,
and they soon after took their departure.</p>

<p>Professor Reinhardt records its occurrence in Greenland, at Fiskenæsset
and at Nenontalik.</p>

<p>The natural breeding-places of these birds, before the settlement of the
country, were caves, overhanging rocky cliffs, and similar localities. Swallow
Cave, at Nahant, was once a favorite place of resort, and in the unsettled
portions of the country they are only found in such situations. As the
country is settled they forsake these places for the buildings of the farm,
and their numbers rapidly increase. In the fur countries and in all the
Pacific coast, they still breed in and inhabit caves, chiefly among limestone
rocks.</p>

<p>Where the opportunity offers, they prefer to place their nests on the horizontal
rafters of barns. Built in this situation, the nests have an average
height and a breadth of about five inches. The cavity is two inches deep
and three inches wide, at the rim. The nests are constructed of distinct
layers of mud, from ten to twelve in number, and each separated by strata
of fine dry grasses. These layers are each made up of small pellets of mud,
that have been worked over by the birds and placed one by one in juxtaposition
until each layer is complete. These mud walls are an inch in thickness.
When they are completed, they are warmly stuffed with fine soft grasses
and lined with downy feathers. When built against the side of a house, a
strong foundation of mud is first constructed, upon which the nest is erected.
In this case the nest is much more elongate in shape and more strongly
made.</p>

<p>A striking peculiarity of these nests is frequently an extra platform, built
against, but distinct from the nest itself, designed as a roosting-place for
the parents, used by one during incubation at night or when not engaged in
procuring food, and by both when the young are large enough to occupy the
whole nest. One of these I found to be a separate structure from the nest,
but of similar materials, three inches in length and one and a half in breadth.
This nest had been for several years occupied by the same pair, though none
of their offspring ever returned to the same roof to breed in their turn. Yet
in some instances as many as fifty pairs have been known to occupy the
rafters of the same barn.</p>

<p><!--402.png--><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 343]</span>
In one instance Mr. Allen has known a pair of these Swallows to take
possession of the nest of a pair of Cliff Swallows, placed under the eaves
of a barn, driving off the rightful owners. The next year they built a nest
in the same place, the old one having fallen down. But such instances are
rare, and the attempt is often a failure.</p>

<p>The wonderful activity of this bird, its rapidity and powers of flight, are
too striking a peculiarity of this species not to be mentioned. During their
stay with us, from May to September, from morn to night they seem to be
ever in motion, especially so before incubation, or after their young have
flown. The rapidity of their tortuous evolutions, their intricate, involved,
and repeated zigzag flights, are altogether indescribable, and must be witnessed
to be appreciated. Wilson estimated that these birds fly at the rate
of a mile a minute, but any one who has witnessed the ease and celerity with
which they seem to delight in overtaking, passing, and repassing a train of
cars moving at the rate of thirty miles an hour must realize that this estimate
is far from doing full justice to their real speed.</p>

<p>The song of this Swallow, especially when on the wing, is very pleasing
and sprightly. It is a succession of twittering notes uttered with great
rapidity and animation. When alighted, their notes are delivered more
slowly and with much less animation.</p>

<p>The attention of these birds to each other when sitting upon the nest, and
to their young when hatched, is unremitting. The estimated numbers of
small insects they collect for their own consumption and that of their nestlings
is almost incredible. When the young are old enough to leave their
nests the manœuvres of the parents to draw them out, and their assistance
to them when practising their first short flights, are among the most curious
and interesting scenes one can witness in his ornithological experiences;
but space would fail me were I to attempt their details.</p>

<p>The number of the young is from four to six, and there are often two
broods in a season. As soon as the second brood can fly, or early in September,
they all prepare to leave. They usually collect in flocks of from one
to several hundred, and depart within a few days of their first assembling.
Large flocks pass along the coast of Massachusetts, from the north and east,
early in September, often uniting as they meet, and passing rapidly on.</p>

<p>Their eggs have a ground-color of clear white, with a roseate tint when
unblown. They are marked with spots of reddish and purplish-brown, varying
in size and number, and chiefly at the larger end. They are smaller and
more elongate than those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lunifrons</i>, and the markings are usually finer.
Their greatest length is .94 of an inch, their least .75, and their mean .78.
Their mean breadth is .56 of an inch, the greatest .62, and the least .50.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This Swallow has quite an extended distribution. Found
throughout North America in the seasons of its migrations, or breeding, it is
only a little less restricted in its area of nesting than the preceding species.
It breeds from latitude 38<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> to
high Arctic regions, and is also
resident throughout the year in
the Plateau of Mexico. It is
abundant in winter in the West
Indies, in Central America, and
in Northern South America. It
is a common bird about Boston,
where it replaces the Purple
Martin, and is even more abundant
in the British Provinces.
Dr. Cooper also found it a very
common species in the western
portions of Washington Territory, where it was invariably found to breed
in hollow trees. In California he states it to be a more or less constant
resident, a few wintering in the southern portion of the State. He met with
it both at San Diego and at Stockton, in February. He regards them as
the hardiest of the Swallows, preferring the coast and the mountain-tops
for their residence in that State. At Santa Cruz five or six pairs in 1866
were resident through the winter, where he saw them in January during
the coldest of the season. They roosted in the knot-holes in the houses
in which they had previously raised their young.</p>

<p>This Swallow, in the more thickly settled portions of the country in which
it breeds, exhibits a marked departure in many of its habits from those
observed in wilder regions. In the latter places we find it a comparatively
wild species, avoiding the society of man, and breeding exclusively in hollow
trees and stumps, and deserving the name by which it is known in the British
Provinces, of the “Wood Swallow.” In the islands of Grand Menan,
in 1851, where repeated attempts had been made to induce these birds to
build in martin-boxes, the endeavor had been entirely unsuccessful. Yet the
birds were so abundant that hardly a hollow tree or stump, on certain of the
smaller islands, could be found, that did not contain a nest of this species.
This is still the case on the Pacific coast, though not exclusively so. It
was not until after the publication of his Ornithological Biography that Audubon
was aware of any departure from this mode of nesting on the part of
this Swallow, although it had not escaped the notice of Wilson.</p>

<p>In Eastern Massachusetts these birds have undergone an entire change of
<!--405.png--><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 346]</span>
habit, breeding there exclusively in martin-boxes, and rarely, if ever, nesting
in hollow trees,&mdash;a fact perhaps attributable to the scarcity of these opportunities
along the sea-coast, where this bird is principally found. In Western
Massachusetts, Mr. Allen states them to be not very common and the least
abundant of the Swallows. Any sheltered and accessible box, however rough
it may be, will answer its purpose, whether the more elaborate martin-house,
or a mere candle-box with an open end. Mr. Audubon has known them to
drive away a Barn Swallow from its nest, and to take possession, but this
was probably exceptional. In one case, two small houses for birds put up in
the same yard were taken possession of by a single pair of Swallows, and
nests built in each; only one, however, of these was made use of. Whether
this freak was the result of indecision or from a grasping selfishness, it is
not possible to conclude, but apparently the former.</p>

<p>In the rural districts, even on the coast, these birds are not so abundant as
in the cities, as in the latter they are less annoyed by other birds. The common
Robin is often especially aggressive, seeking to drive them off his assumed
premises. In one instance the Robin has been known to station himself
on a platform in front of its nest for hours, and persistently refuse to
permit its visits. Assistance was sought, and all the Swallows in the neighborhood
came to the rescue. They sailed with angry cries over the head of
the offender, at times darting down upon him as if to strike at him, but
accomplishing nothing. The besieger maintained his ground until the writer intervened
and drove him away, when the Swallows once more took possession,
and fed their hungry nestlings in peace.</p>

<p>This species breeds from about latitude 38<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> to the extreme northern regions,
and along the Arctic seas, wherever facilities for nesting are found. Richardson
found them breeding in hollow trees on the Mackenzie River, in latitude
65<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. Everywhere on both coasts they are very common, but are less numerous
in the interior. Mr. Dall found it in Alaska from Fort Yukon to the sea.
It was known to the Russians as the River Swallow. It was also met with
in Sitka, by Bischoff. It has not been observed in Greenland.</p>

<p>During the breeding-season this species is more quarrelsome than any of
its kindred, and is often more than a match for larger birds. Coming earlier
in the season than the Purple Martin, it will often intrude itself into its
premises and maintain possession. They are devotedly attached to their offspring,
and bewail any accidents to them or any threatened peril. The same
pair will return year after year to the same premises, and they soon become
on familiar terms with the members of a family they frequently meet, so
much so as to watch, when they have received materials for their nests, for a
further supply, and will fly close to the person from whom they receive them.
A pair which had thus, year after year, received supplies of feathers for their
nests from the younger members of the family in whose yard their nest was
built, would almost take them from the hands of their providers. This pair
sat so close as to permit themselves to be taken from their nest, and when
<!--406.png--><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 347]</span>
released would at once fly back to their brood. They build a loose, soft, and
warm nest of fine soft leaves and hay, abundantly lined with down and
feathers, with which the eggs are not unfrequently covered. The addition
of soft and warm materials is often made during incubation, and the nest
is thoroughly repaired before it is used for a second brood, of which they
usually have two in a season.</p>

<p>The eggs are of a uniform pure white, and are never spotted. They have
a delicate pinkish shade before they are blown. They are of an oblong-oval
shape, one end more pointed than the other, and they vary considerably in
size. They vary in length from .75 to .875 of an inch, and in breadth from
.50 to .56.</p>

<p>Mr. Hepburn states that the great mass of these birds leave California in
August, but that a few are resident during the winter. The principal accession
to their numbers takes place about the end of February, and they become
quite abundant by the end of March. In Vancouver they are a month
later. In 1853 Mr. Hepburn states that a pair constructed their nest in a
piece of canvass at the end of the yard-arm of a store-ship that lay off the
levee at Sacramento. He first noticed them on the 28th of April, when the
nest had already made some progress. By the 19th of May there were seven
eggs in it which were slightly incubated. The nest was a great mass of
hay and dried grasses, in the midst of which was a cup-shaped depression
very neatly lined with feathers, some of which bent over, forming a slight
dome.</p>

Tail acutely emarginate. Beneath pure white. Above soft velvety-green,
with a very faint shade of purplish-violet concentrated on the nape into a transverse band.
Rump rather more vivid green; tail-coverts showing a good deal of purple. Colors of

Western and Middle Provinces of United States., south to Guatemala, east to the
Upper Missouri. Breeds on Plateau of Mexico (<span class="sc">Sumichrast</span>).</p>

<p>Young birds are of a dull velvety grayish-brown, not unlike the shade of
color of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cotyle riparia</i>, but may be distinguished by the absence of the tuft
of feathers at base of toes, and the gray (not white) bases of the feathers of
under parts. There is only an ashy shade across the breast, not a pectoral
band.</p>

<p><!--407.png--><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 348]</span>
There is much variation among individuals regarding the distribution of
the semi-metallic tints of the upper parts; generally the whole dorsal region
is overlaid by a “dusting,” as it were, of soft brownish-purple; in specimens
colored thus, the upper tail-coverts are pure dark-green, without a tinge of
purple. In other specimens, on the contrary, the dorsal region is nearly
pure green, that of the upper tail-coverts less golden, and mixed with a very
beautiful rich soft violet.</p>

<p>Winter specimens from Guatemala and Mexico have the upper secondaries
very sharply and broadly bordered terminally with pure white.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Violet-green Swallow is a common bird, from the central
plains of North America to the Pacific coast, and is found at different seasons
from Washington Territory to South America. It has been found as far
east as Nebraska, and in abundance at Fort Bridger, in Utah.</p>

<p>As observed, in Washington Territory, by Drs. Suckley and Cooper, it is
said to arrive at Puget Sound early in May, and to frequent entirely the high
prairies bordered with oak and other deciduous trees, in the knot-holes of
which, or in deserted Woodpeckers’ holes, it breeds. Its song is described as
pleasing and varied, but rather weak. They found it to be quite abundant
in the interior of Oregon and of Washington Territory, and in its habits and
mode of flight hardly distinguishable from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bicolor</i>.</p>

<p>In California, according to the observations of Dr. Cooper, it arrives in
Santa Clara Valley as early as March 15, where it chiefly frequents the groves
of oaks along the sides of the valleys, across the whole Coast Range, excepting
in the immediate neighborhood of the sea. Their nest, so far as known, is
always in the knot-holes of oaks, and they have never been known to breed in
the immediate vicinity of dwellings, excepting only when their favorite trees
were so situated. It is generally in an inaccessible place, and their eggs
are not often obtained. These are pure white, resembling those of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bicolor</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">riparia</i>. Townsend states that he found them nesting in the
deserted nests of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. lunifrons</i>, but in this he may have been mistaken.
The eggs he gave to Mr. Audubon as those of this species undoubtedly
belonged to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lunifrons</i>. They leave California for the south in September.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues also found this Swallow in Arizona, where it was the most
abundant and characteristic Swallow of the pine regions of that Territory.
It is a summer resident at Fort Whipple, where it arrives about March 20,
and remains until late in September.</p>

<p>In the Province of Vera Cruz, Mr. Sumichrast found this Swallow resident,
not only in the hot belt of the coast, but also in the temperate region and
throughout the plateau, at almost all heights, and was almost everywhere
very common.</p>

<p>Mr. Salvin also states that early in March great numbers occur near Duenas,
Guatemala, where they remain for a short time. During that time they
are to be found flying over the open land to the south of the Lake of Duenas.</p>

<p><!--408.png--><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 349]</span>
Mr. Hepburn states that this Swallow has quite an extensive range along
the Pacific coast, but is restricted as to the localities it inhabits. At the
Pulgas Ranche, near San Francisco, it is even more common than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bicolor</i>,
while a few miles from thence not one is to be seen. He has also seen it on
the banks of the Fresno, near its junction with the San Joaquin River, and
again in the Yosemite Valley, without meeting with a single specimen in the
intervening country. About Victoria this was the prevailing species. These
Swallows, so far as Mr. Hepburn observed, always build in holes of trees.
Their nest, he states, is formed of a few fine dry stems of grass, placed at the
bottom of the hole, covered over with a thick mass of feathers. The eggs,
he adds, are pure white, large for the size of the bird, measuring .81 of
an inch in length by .50 in breadth. These Swallows have two broods in a
season. In 1864 he noted their arrival in San Mateo County on the 28th of
March.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway writes that he first met with the Violet-green Swallow in
May, on the islands in Pyramid Lake. He there found it very abundant
among the cliffs of calcareous tufa of which the island was composed. They
were seen to enter the fissures of the rock to their nests within, which it was
found impossible to reach. They were again seen in July among the limestone
cliffs along the cañons of the East Humboldt Mountains, associated
with the White-throated Swift, building like them in the small horizontal
crevices or fissures on the face of the precipice. He was not able to get at
more than two of their nests, the first in a horizontal fissure just wide enough
to admit the hand, and about eight inches from the entrance. It contained
five young. The nest was similar to that of the Bank Swallow, and was
composed of sticks, straws, and feathers. In the other the female was dead
on her nest, and the eggs were broken. They were white, like those of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. bicolor</i>.</p>

<p>In its flight this bird is said to greatly resemble the White-bellied Swallow,
but is distinguishable by the contrast of the three colors of its upper
plumage. These two species are rarely to be seen in the same localities, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bicolor</i> preferring wooded, and this species rocky localities.</p>

<p>Mr. Lord states that this beautiful Swallow was common from the coast
along the entire course of the boundary line, to the summit of the Rocky
Mountains. They were among the earliest visitors at Colville, arriving in
small flocks in March, but in greater numbers in May and June. They build
in June, making their nests in holes in dead trees as high as they can get,
and lay four or five eggs. The nest is made of feathers and soft hair. They
assemble in large flocks before migrating in September. Mr. Lord felt pretty
sure their nesting-holes were excavated in the soft wood by themselves,
though their soft beak seems ill adapted to perform such labor.</p>

Bill rather small; nostrils oval, superior, margined behind, but scarcely
laterally by membrane, but not at all overhung;
the axes of the outline converging. Frontal
feathers soft, and, like chin, without bristles.
Tarsi equal to middle toe without claw; the
upper end covered with feathers all round,
none at lower end. Basal joint of middle toe
adherent externally nearly to end; internally,
scarcely half. Lateral toes about equal, their
claws not reaching beyond base of middle claw.
Tail slightly emarginate; the feathers broad, and obliquely rounded at end. Edge of the
wing rough to the touch; the shafts of the fibrillæ of outer web of outer primary prolonged
and bent at right angles into a short stiff hook. Nest (of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. serripennis</i>) in holes
in banks; eggs pure white, unspotted.</p>

<p class="small">Color dull brown above.</p>

<p>The great peculiarity of this genus consists in the remarkable roughness
of the edge of the wing, said to occur also in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Psalidoprocne</i>, <abbr title="Cabanis"><span class="sc">Cab.</span></abbr> The object
is uncertain, but is probably to enable the bird to secure a foothold on
vertical or inclined rocks, among or on which it makes its nest. A favorite
breeding-place of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. serripennis</i> is in the piers and abutments of bridges, and
these hooks might render essential aid in entering into their holes.</p>

<p>The birds of this genus have usually been referred to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cotyle</i>, which, however,
they resemble only in color. The nostrils are exposed, instead of being
overhung; the tarsus is bare below, not feathered, and the lateral claws are
considerably curved, and not reaching beyond the base of the lateral, as in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cotyle</i>. The structure of the wing is very different.</p>

<p>There are at least five species or races of this genus in America, although
only one belongs with certainty to the United States. A second, however,
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. fulvipennis</i>), Mexican and Guatemalan, is not unlikely to occur in Arizona
or New Mexico. This differs in having the chin and throat
reddish-fulvous,
not mouse-gray; the belly tinged with yellow.</p>

Whole United States (exclusive of Northeastern States?) south to Central

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Rough-winged Swallow was first met with by Audubon, in
Louisiana, but described by him from specimens afterwards procured near
Charleston, <abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr> He knew nothing in regard to its habits, and its distribution
was equally unknown to him. It has since been found, but nowhere very
abundantly, in various parts of the United States. It has not been met with
on the Atlantic coast farther to the north than New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
On the Pacific coast it is more common. Dr. Suckley speaks of it as quite
abundant both in Oregon and in Washington Territory. Dr. Cooper, in his
Zoölogy of Washington Territory, speaks of it as common about the sandy
cliffs of the bays and inlets of that coast, arriving near the Columbia in
May, and remaining only until the middle of August, when all these Swallows
go southwards, though their last brood is hardly able to fly. He says
that they burrow holes in the soft sandy banks near the tops of cliffs, and
have generally the same habits as the common Bank Swallow. They have
no song, only a few chirping calls.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper, in his Report on the birds of California, further states that this
Swallow, in summer, is found throughout the lower portions of that State.
He saw them at Fort Mojave as early as the 27th of February, and as he has
met with them at San Diego in November, and also in January, he thinks
they may winter within the State. He describes their burrows in the sandy
banks of rivers as being to the depth of three feet, crowded very near
together, and near the upper edge of the bank, in no wise different from the
nesting of the common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. riparia</i>. The nests are composed chiefly of dry
grasses, with a few feathers, and contain five white eggs. Occasionally, however,
they resort to natural clefts in the bank or in buildings, and to knotholes
in trees. In the fall they congregate in great numbers about certain
favorite spots, and keep much together in flocks. At night they roost in
<!--411.png--><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 352]</span>
their burrows. In Arizona, according to Dr. Coues, they are summer residents,
breeding abundantly, arriving late in April and remaining until nearly
the last of September.</p>

<p>At Eagle Pass, Mr. Dresser met these birds, arriving from the South, on
the 21st of February. There, and also at San Antonio, they were very common,
breeding in the towns, making their nests under the eaves and in holes
in the old walls, depositing their eggs by the 25th of April. Dr. Kennerly
also found this Swallow very abundant along the Colorado River in February.
Its flight seemed to him to be like that of the common Barn Swallow.
Dr. Heermann frequently met with this species during the journey from the
junction of the Gila and Colorado Rivers through Mexico, New Mexico, and
Texas, to San Antonio. In the latter place he found them breeding almost
entirely in crevices in the walls of houses.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Washington, Dr. Coues found this Swallow a summer
resident, but rather rare, arriving in the third week of April, and leaving
about the middle of September.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway speaks of this bird as one of the most abundant Swallows
of the West, inhabiting the river valleys, and breeding in holes in the banks
of the rivers. He says that in Southern Illinois it is much more abundant
than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. riparia</i>, though both nest in the same banks.</p>

<p>This species was first found breeding in Carlisle, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>, by Professor Baird,
in the summer of 1843. The following year I visited this locality early in
June, and had an opportunity to study its habits during its breeding-season.
We found the bird rather common, and examined a number of their nests.
None that we met with were in places that had been excavated by the birds,
although the previous season several had been found that had apparently
been excavated in banks in the same manner with the Bank Swallow. All
the nests (seven in number) that we then met with were in situations accidentally
adapted to their need, and all were directly over running water.
Some were constructed in crevices between the stones in the walls and arches
of bridges. In several instances the nests were but little above the surface
of the stream. In one, the first laying had been flooded, and the eggs chilled.
The birds had constructed another nest above the first one, in which were
six fresh eggs, as many as in the other. One nest had been built between
the stones of the wall that formed one of the sides of the flume of a mill.
Two feet above it was a frequented footpath, and, at the same distance below,
the water of the mill-stream. Another nest was between the boards of a
small building in which revolved a water-wheel. The entrance to it was
through a knot-hole in the outer partition, and the nest rested on a small
rafter between the outer and the inner boardings.</p>

<p>The nests were similar in their construction to those of the Bank Swallow,
composed of dry grasses, straws, and leaves, and lined with a few feathers;
but a much greater amount of material was made use of, owing, perhaps, to
the exposed positions in which they were built.</p>

<p><!--412.png--><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 353]</span>
The eggs, six in number, in every instance that we noticed, were pure white,

<p>Many American birds have been referred to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cotyle</i>, but the only one really
belonging to the genus is the cosmopolitan
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. riparia</i>. The peculiarity of
the genus consists essentially in the
tuft of tarsal feathers at the base of
the hind toe, and the unusual length
of the lateral claws, combined with
the lateral nostrils overhung by membrane.
By these characters the genus is very easily distinguished from

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Bank Swallow as we know it, or Sand Martin as
it is called in England, is nearly or
quite cosmopolitan in its distribution.
Found throughout Europe in the season
of reproduction, and in portions
of Africa in the winter months, it is
equally common throughout North
America in the summer, and probably
winters in Mexico and in Central
and South America, though it is
not mentioned by Sumichrast as a
bird of Vera Cruz. It is said to occur
in various parts of the continent
of Africa, and in Europe it extends
its migrations to the extreme northern
regions. It has also been met
with in India and in Siberia. Mr.
Salvin obtained several specimens at Duenas, Guatemala, in September,
1861, having previously observed it about the Lake of Yzabah.</p>

<p>On both continents it is somewhat local in its distribution, in favorable
localities being quite abundant, and in others not known to exist. It is an
early spring visitant wherever found, appearing in England by the 24th of
March, and even in our high Arctic regions early in May, often in such inclement
weather that it is obliged to take refuge in holes. Mr. Dall met
with this species in Alaska, in favorable situations, in immense numbers.
He counted on the face of one sand-bluff over seven hundred nest-holes
made by these birds, and all of them apparently occupied, so that the
bluff presented the appearance of an immense honeycomb alive with bees.
He states that it takes the bird four days to excavate its nest. <abbr title="Review">Rev.</abbr> F. O.
Morris, on the other hand, who has closely watched their operations in England,
says that it requires a fortnight, and that the weight of sand a pair
of these birds removes is twenty ounces in a day. Pebbles of more than two
ounces in weight have been known to be taken out by them.</p>

<p>The flight of this species is rapid, but unsteady and flickering. In searching
for their food they skim low over the surface of both land and water,
dropping upon the latter, as they fly, to drink or to bathe. Their food
consists of the smaller kinds of winged insects, which they pursue and capture,
dashing at them at times even on the water. They usually feed their
young with larger kinds than they eat themselves.</p>

<p>It has not been observed in Greenland, but Richardson found it in colonies
of thousands at the mouth of Mackenzie’s River, in the 68th parallel. It is
a very social bird, usually breeding together in large communities, and is
<!--414.png--><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 355]</span>
more independent of man than most of its family, owing him no other favors
than those incident to excavations through sand-banks, of which it avails
itself. The nests of these Swallows are placed in excavations made by
them in the banks of rivers, cliffs by the sea-shore, and similar favorable
situations. These are usually as near the surface of the ground as the
nature of the soil permits to be readily penetrated, though the bird has
been known to work its way even through hard gravel. Their depth varies
from fourteen inches to four feet, though two feet is the usual distance.</p>

<p>Mr. Augustus Fowler mentions a remarkable instance of sagacity and
provident forethought in these birds, not easily separable from reason. In
the town of Beverly, in a stratum of sandy loam, he observed each season a
colony of some twenty or thirty pairs of these birds. In this place these
birds never burrowed more than two or three feet. Within a mile of this
place another colony excavated a bank in which the layer of loam was mixed
with small stones. In this bank they excavated to the depth of five, seven,
and even nine feet. Why was there this extraordinary difference in the
length of burrows made by the same species, in situations not more than a
mile apart? The reason for this difference, upon examination, became very
obvious. We give the explanation in Mr. Fowler’s own words: “In one
bank, where the earth was of a fine sandy loam, easily perforated, from the
entrance to the extremity the burrows did not exceed three feet in length;
while in the other bank, with harder loam to work in, one burrow was found
nine feet in length. After examining six holes of nearly equal length, it
appeared that these little birds had sufficient reason for extending their labors
so far into the earth. In every instance, where they met with a spot free
from stones they finished their burrows; thus showing great care for the
welfare of their eggs or young by avoiding, in the stony soil, a catastrophe so
great as would befall their treasures if by accident one of these stones should
fall upon them.”</p>

<p>The work of perforation they perform with their closed bill, swaying the
body round on the feet, beginning at the centre and working outwards. This
long and often winding gallery gradually expands into a small spherical
apartment, on the floor of which they form a rude nest of straw and feathers.
The time occupied in making these excavations varies greatly with the
nature of the soil, from four or five days to twice that number.</p>

<p>Their eggs are five in number, pure white, and when unblown have a fine
roseate hue. They are oval in shape, larger at one end, and pointed at
the smaller. Their average length is .72 of an inch, and their average
breadth .47.</p>

<p>We now come to the consideration of three families of Oscine birds, of
pre-eminently dentirostral type, having certain common characters by which
they are distinguishable, with but little difficulty, from all others. In their
close relationship it has been questioned by many whether they do not all
belong under one head, but they are more generally considered distinct.
The common characters, and those peculiar to each, are as follows:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="small"><span class="sc">Common Characters.</span> Bill stout, and considerably hooked at tip, or with the point bent
abruptly downward; with a deep notch, and sometimes a tooth or lobe just behind the
notch; the tip of the lower mandible likewise frequently bent up, and with a notch
behind it. The nostrils lateral, the bristles of the mouth generally well developed. The
primaries are ten (except in a few <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireos</i>), the outer from one fourth to one half the second.
Tail variable. Tarsi scutellate anteriorly; sometimes with a tendency to division on
the lateral plates; hitherto not met with. Basal joints of toes more adherent. Separated
from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdidæ</i> by greater adhesion of toes; from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Troglodytidæ</i> by notched and hooked
bill, etc.</p>

<p class="small"><b class="subset">A.</b> Basal phalanx of anterior toes abbreviated; that of median toe decidedly shorter than
the basal of inner, or the two basal of outer, and adherent for its whole length on both
sides to the lateral (i. e. not free at all). Lateral plates of tarsus undivided, except at
extreme lower end.</p>

<p class="small indent"><b class="birdname">Vireonidæ.</b> Gonys more than half the length of lower jaw (from tip to angle of
mouth), usually longer than width of mouth, which is narrow. Bill conical, much
compressed, decurved at end and notched, but scarcely toothed. Frontal feathers
bristly and erect, or bent but slightly forward. Nostrils overhung by membrane.
Tarsus longer than middle toe and claw. Lateral toes generally unequal; outer claw
reaching half-way along middle claw.</p>

<p class="small"><b class="subset">B.</b> Basal phalanx of middle toe about as long as the basal of inner, or the two basal of
outer; free externally, at least for about one third its length, internally for about one
half. Lateral plates of tarsus with decided tendency to subdivision (except in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myiadestinæ</i>).</p>

<p class="small indent"><b class="birdname">Ampelidæ.</b> Gonys decidedly less than half the length of lower jaw, or than width
of mouth, which is very broad and deeply cleft. Bill triangular, much depressed, decurved
at end and notched, with moderate though decided tooth. Frontal feathers
rather soft, scarcely bristly or erect. Nostrils overhung by membrane. Tarsus equal
to or shorter than middle toe and claw. Lateral toes nearly equal; outer claw reaching
only to base of middle claw.</p>

<p class="small indent"><b class="birdname">Laniidæ.</b> Gonys about half the length of lower jaw; about equal to width of mouth.
Bill very powerful and raptorial, much compressed, with a strongly marked hook,
notch, and tooth at end. Frontal feathers very bristly, and directed forwards, so as
to conceal nostrils and base of bill. Nostrils with bony walls, except behind. Tarsus
longer than middle toe and claw, sometimes much scutellate on sides. Lateral claws
nearly equal; outer claw reaching a little beyond base of middle claw.</p>

<h2><span class="sc">Family</span> <b class="birdname">VIREONIDÆ</b>.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Vireos.</span></h2>

<p class="p2">The essential features of this family appear to consist in the combination
of the dentirostral bill, notched in both mandibles; the ten primaries (except
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireosylvia</i>), of which the outer is usually from one fourth to one half the
second; the rather short, nearly even tail, with narrow feathers, and the
great amount of adhesion of the anterior toes,&mdash;the whole basal joint of
the middle being generally united on both sides to the adjacent joints, and
decidedly shorter than the basal of inner or two basal of outer. The outer
lateral toe is generally appreciably longer than the inner, reaching considerably
beyond the base of the middle claw. The tarsi are always distinctly
scutellate anteriorly. The young are never spotted, or streaked as
in the Thrushes; nor, indeed, do the adults exhibit such markings.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireonidæ</i> are peculiar to the New World, and are widely distributed,
although but one genus belongs to the United States.</p>

<p>No great violence will be done by considering all the American Vireos as
belonging to one genus, divisible into three subgenera, as, however different
the extremes of the series may be from each other, the gradation is quite
complete.</p>

<p>The North American species take a wide range during their southern
winter migration, only paralleled in this respect by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvicolidæ</i>; they do
not visit the West Indies, save as very rare stragglers to Cuba (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. olivaceus</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solitarius</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flavifrons</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">noveboracensis</i>). They all have a melodious song, and,
so far as known, make a deep nest, suspended by its upper edge between the
forks of a horizontal twig. The eggs are white, generally with a few reddish
or brown blotches.</p>

<p>Quite a number are characterized by having the eyes white, red, or

<p>This <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireo</i> has been taken several times at Charlotte Harbor, in Florida,
<!--422.png--><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 361]</span>
and is thus entitled to a place in our fauna. Its distinction from a closely
allied race in Jamaica, Hayti, etc., <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calidris</i>, is shown on page 359.</p>

<p>A specimen belonging to Mr. Salvin (“<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 187.), from “Isthmus of Panama,”
we cannot distinguish satisfactorily from typical examples of the present
race, with which it is to be compared, and not with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calidris</i>. The colors are
quite identical with those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">barbatulus</i>. In size it is slightly larger, the
wing measuring 3.25 instead of 3.15; the tail 2.50, instead of 2.35 (from
exposed base of feathers); the bill is thicker, being .20 instead of .18 deep;
the third quill is longest, the second intermediate between it and the fourth;
the first intermediate between the fourth and fifth. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">barbatulus</i> the second
is longest, the third and fourth successively a little shorter. It is not
improbable that other specimens from that locality may show greater differences,
as the specimen under examination is in rather worn plumage, and
has the tip of the bill broken off.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species only claims a place in our avifauna on the ground
of its presence in Florida. How abundant it is there is not determined, further
than it has been observed within a restricted locality by Dr. Heermann.
This was at Charlotte Harbor, on the southwestern coast. They appeared
to be visitors only, from a more southern clime. They reached Florida in
their northern migrations, remaining only for a short season, but evidently
staying long enough to breed. Dr. Heermann states that this species resembles,
in manners and in appearance, the common Red-eyed Vireo of the
more northern States. He describes its song as clear and musical, and very
distinctly uttered. It was constantly on the search for insects, and appeared
even more active than any of the northern species, darting among the foliage,
peering into crevices and cobwebs, suspended from branches with its back
downward, and occasionally chasing a flying insect in the manner of a true
Flycatcher. These movements were usually accompanied by a song. This
species was not abundant, though Dr. Heermann saw it frequently, and
obtained several specimens.</p>

<p>Dr. Bryant found this species very abundant at the Bahamas, arriving
there about the first of May. All the specimens he obtained were males,
the females not arriving there until after the 13th of May. The notes of
these birds, he states, vary, though the most common one resembles
<i class="birdcall">whīp tom kĕllȳ pheūū</i>, pronouncing the first word distinctly.</p>

<p>This bird,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_76" id="fnanchor_76"></a><a href="#footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></span>
in Brown’s History of Jamaica, is called “Whip-tom-kelly,”
from the supposed resemblance of its notes to these articulate sounds, and
this popular appellation has been given it by various other writers. Mr.
Gosse, however, in his Birds of Jamaica, calls this bird “John-to-whit,” and
can find no resemblance in its notes to the words referred to. He describes
its song as uttered with incessant iteration and untiring energy, and as
resembling <i class="birdcall">Sweet-John! John to whit! sweet John to whit!</i> After July the
<!--423.png--><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 362]</span>
notes change to <i class="birdcall">to-whit-to-whoo</i>, and sometimes to a soft, simple chirp, whispered
so gently as scarcely to be audible. The name of Whip-tom-kelly
Mr. Gosse never heard applied to it in Jamaica. Yet it is a bird often heard,
and one whose notes have a similarity to articulate sounds, and naturally
suggest a common appellation. It is very vociferous and pertinacious in its
calls, repeating them with energy every two or three seconds.</p>

<p>This species, he states, does not ordinarily sit on a prominent twig, or dart
out after insects, though it has been seen in eager pursuit of a butterfly. It
seems to live in the centre of thick woods. It does not pass the winter in
Jamaica, but leaves at the beginning of October, returning as early as the
20th of March. Its food he states to be both animal and vegetable, as he
found in its stomach the seeds of the tropical plants and berries. In April,
Mr. Gosse observed it hunting insects by the borders of the Bluefields River,
and so intent upon its occupation as to allow of a very near approach. It
sought insects among the grass and low herbage, perching on the stalks of
weeds, and darting out after both vagrant and stationary prey. They incubate
in June and July.</p>

<p>Like all this genus the Long-billed Vireo builds a pensile nest of great
architectural ingenuity and beauty. It is a deep cup, usually about two
thirds of a sphere in shape, truncated at the top. The materials of which
it is made are often somewhat coarse. Mr. Gosse describes it as about as
large as an ordinary teacup, narrowed at the mouth, composed of dry grasses,
silk, cotton, lichens, and spiders’-web. It is usually suspended from the fork
of two twigs, the margin very neatly overwoven to embrace them. The
materials are well interwoven, and the walls firm and close, though not very
thick. The whole is smoothly lined with slender vegetable fibres resembling
human hair. One nest had its cavity nearly filled with a mass of white cotton,
interwoven with the other materials, which, being picked cotton, had
evidently been taken from some yard or building.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are three in number, of a brilliant white, delicately
tinted with pink, and marked with a few fine red and red-brown
spots, usually about the larger end.</p>

<p>An egg of the variety from Cuba is of an oblong-oval shape, slightly
pointed at one end, and the markings of faint purple and of dark purplish-brown,
in bold dashes, are all about the larger end. Another from the same
locality is more distinctly rounded at one and pointed at the other end, and
is marked with fine brown dots distributed over the whole egg. These eggs
measure, one .825 by .55 of an inch, and the other .78 by .55. An egg from
Jamaica is of an extremely oblong-oval, measuring .88 by .55 of an inch, and
is boldly marked more or less over the entire egg with large blotches of purplish-brown.</p>

<p>The Messrs. Newton describe the nest of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calidris</i> of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix as a beautiful
structure, shaped like an inverted cone, composed outwardly of dried
blades of grass, dried leaves, and wool, woven round the twigs, to which it
<!--424.png--><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 363]</span>
was attached with spiders’-webs, lined inside with finer blades of grass, and
about three inches and a half in diameter, and five in height. The eggs,
three in number, were white, with a few black spots, chiefly disposed about
the larger end.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Red-eyed Vireo is an abundant species throughout
Eastern North America, from Florida to Nova Scotia on the northeast, to
Lake Winnepeg on the northwest, and as far west as the Rocky Mountains.
It apparently breeds wherever found, and in especial abundance in the Central
States. It is a familiar and fearless species, often found, like the Warbling
Vireo, in the very midst of crowded cities,
and making its lively and pleasant notes
heard in their public squares and private
gardens, amid the ruder sounds of the
neighboring streets. It breeds in Texas
and Louisiana, at the Southwest, and also
in abundance, at least as far as Halifax,
in the opposite direction. At Fort Resolution,
at the Cumberland House, and at
Fort Simpson, the nests and eggs of this
species were procured by Kennicott and
Ross. A single specimen of the bird has
been procured in Greenland, and another
accidental specimen was shot in England. Specimens have also been procured
in Central America.</p>

<p>This Vireo, like all of its peculiar and well-marked genus, prefers the
forests or the tops of large and shady trees, obtains its food usually among,
their upper branches, and very rarely approaches the ground. It is not exclusively
sylvan, as at times it may be found around dwellings, hunting
for insects and spiders; and although it hunts for food among the tree-tops,
its nest is not always in such high situations, often not more than four or
five feet from the ground.</p>

<p>In their migrations these birds enter the United States early in March, but
do not make their appearance in Pennsylvania until the last of April, or in
New England until the middle of May.</p>

<p>The Vireos procure their food, for the most part, by moving about and
along branches, and among the twigs of trees, hopping from one position to
another, and securing their prey without the click of a Flycatcher. The insects
they capture are usually not in motion, though occasionally they will
take them on the wing. They also feed on several kinds of ripe berries in
the autumn.</p>

<p>The song of this Vireo is loud, musical, simple, and pleasing. It is uttered
in short, emphatic bars, and at times has a very marked resemblance to the
melodious chant of the Robin, though without its volume and power. This
Vireo is one of the earliest of our spring musicians, as it is also one of the
most constant and untiring in its song, continuing to sing long after most of
the other vocalists have become silent, and even until it is about to leave
us, at the close of September. The tender and pathetic utterances of this
Vireo, uttered with so much apparent animation, to judge from their sound,
<!--426.png--><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 365]</span>
are in striking contrast to the apparent indifference or unconsciousness of the
little vocalist who, while thus delighting the ear of the listener, seems to be
all the while chiefly bent on procuring its daily supply of food, which it
pursues with unabated ardor.</p>

<p>This Vireo builds the neat pensile nest of its race, suspending it from the
fork of two or more twigs of a forest tree, at various heights of from five to
fifty feet from the ground. It is cup-like in shape, and always dependent
from small twigs, around which its upper edges are firmly bound. Externally
it is woven of various materials, fine strips of bark, the hempen fibres
of vegetables, and webs of spiders and of various caterpillars. These are
compactly pressed and woven, and, as some suppose, agglutinated by the
saliva of the builder. Sometimes the unmanageable materials give to the
outside of the nest a rude and unfinished appearance, at others they are
evenly and smoothly wrought. They are very strong, uninjured by the
storms of winter, and are often made use of by other birds, by mice, and
even by the same bird a second season.</p>

<p>A nest of this bird (<abbr title="Smithsonian Institution Collection">S. I. Coll.</abbr>, 3,353) was obtained at the Cumberland
House by Mr. Kennicott. It is pensile, like all others, but is composed
almost exclusively of pine-needles,&mdash;a dry and hard material, difficult of
management in making such a nest. With these are intermingled a few bits
of moss, fine strips of bark, and flax-like vegetable fibres. Within this rude
basket is an inner nest, made up of fine dry grasses, strips of bark, and pine
leaves. The external fabric is loosely put together,&mdash;an unusual feature,&mdash;but
the inner portion, in the firmness and strength with which it was made,
is in remarkable contrast.</p>

<p>The Red-eyed Vireo’s nest is often chosen by the Cowbird for the deposition
of her parasitic eggs, and these foster-parents are singularly devoted in
the care of their alien guests, whom they tenderly nurture, even to the neglect
of their own offspring. In one instance three eggs of a Cowbird were
deposited in the nest of the Vireo before any of her own, and, without laying
any, the female Vireo proceeded to sit upon and hatch the intruders. In
another case, where two of the Vireo’s had been laid, two Cowbird’s eggs
were added. The Vireo stopped laying, and proceeded to incubate. In each
instance the female Vireo seemed to forego her own natural aspirations, and
at once conform to the new situation.</p>

<p>The male Vireo often evinces great courage and spirit in the defence of his
nest, when the young are hatched driving away intruders, and even flying in
the face of a man who approaches too near.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall states that the young of the Red-eyed Vireo feed eagerly upon
the berries of the cornel and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Viburnum dentatum</i>, and other shrubs. A
young bird kept in confinement soon became very gentle, and readily ate flies
and grasshoppers from his hand, and viburnum berries. A tame Kingbird
in the same room was very jealous of and tyrannized over him, so as to
compel him to seek protection from his captor. The Vireos, like Flycatchers,
<!--427.png--><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 366]</span>
have the power to regurgitate by the bill pellets of indigestible portions of
their food.</p>

<p>The eggs of this Vireo vary greatly in size, according to the locality; the
farther south the smaller they are found. One, marked on the shell East
Tennessee, June 1, 1858, Alex. Gerhardt, measures .78 by .52 of an inch,
while one from Halifax, Nova Scotia, measures .95 by .65. The <a id="chg8" name="chg8"></a>ground-color
of all is a clear crystal-white, and they are marked chiefly at the larger
end with spots and finer dots of red-brown.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Kennicott, in his notes, speaks of finding a nest of the Red-eyed
Vireo at the Cumberland House, Saskatchewan, June 28. Incubation
had not yet commenced. The pensile and neatly built nest was suspended
about four feet from the ground, upon a hazel-bush. The parent, when
scared from it, remained near until she was killed.</p>

Eastern North America to Hudson’s Bay and Maine, south (in winter) to Costa
Rica and Guatemala. Veragua (<span class="sc">Salvin</span>). Not recorded from Mexico or West Indies.</p>

<p>Specimens vary somewhat in purity of tints, and especially in intensity
of yellow of under parts, which color is deeper in autumnal skins.</p>

<p>Specimens from Costa Rica and Guatemala, being merely winter visitors
to that region, are quite identical with North American examples.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This but little known species was first described by Mr. Cassin,
in 1851, from a specimen shot by him in some woods near Philadelphia nine
years previously, which was then unique, and remained so for some time after.
This fact, and its resemblance to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. gilva</i>, led to the impression that it might
be only a variety of that species. Since the publication of the description
other specimens have been procured from different localities,&mdash;Moose Factory,
Maine, Ohio, Wisconsin, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. But little is as yet
known in regard to its habits or its distribution. It is quite abundant in the
spring in Southern Wisconsin, where it appears only as a migrant passing north,
none remaining to breed. As it makes its appearance late in May, and
usually passes rapidly on, it seems natural to infer that it cannot be far from
its breeding-place at the period of its appearance. The specimen obtained
by Mr. Cassin was shot in September, on its southward journey. It was in
the upper branches of a high tree, capturing insects; and his attention was
drawn to it by its slow and deliberate movements.</p>

<p>Mr. Thure Kumlien, of Dane County, <abbr title="Wisconsin">Wis.</abbr>, informs me that he has been
familiar with this Vireo since 1849, and has collected it every year since
<!--429.png--><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 368]</span>
that period, finding it both in the spring and fall. It appears occasionally
as early as the 10th of May, the time varying with the season from the 10th
to the 27th. In 1857, when the season was very backward and May very
cold, they did not arrive until June 2. They were unusually numerous, and
remained only a day or two. So far as he has been able to ascertain, none
stop to breed. They are very quiet, have no song at the time they are passing,
and seem only intent on collecting their food and in proceeding on their
way. They are very tame and unsuspecting, and one can readily get to
within a few feet of them. In the fall they are returning south from the 7th
to the 19th of September.</p>

to be found on the Columbia River, but in this he probably referred to
the Western race, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. swainsoni</i>. That writer never observed this species
in Louisiana or Kentucky, nor in the maritime part of Georgia, and its manner
of entering the United States he was unable to ascertain. Where it
moves to in the winter is also unknown, none having been met with in the
West Indies, and only at a few points in Mexico, Cordova, Oaxaca, and the
State of Vera Cruz. It was, however, found breeding at Calcasieu, Louisiana,
by Mr. Würdemann.</p>

<p>It breeds abundantly from Virginia to Nova Scotia, and throughout the
Northwestern States. West of the Rocky Mountains it is replaced by a
closely allied species, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. swainsoni</i>. This Vireo, more than any other of
its genus, if not exclusively, is to a large extent a resident of villages, towns,
and even cities. It is by far the sweetest singer that ventures within their
crowded streets and public squares,&mdash;although Mr. Cassin gives his preference
to the notes of the Red-eyed,&mdash;and the melody of its song is exquisitely
soft and beautiful. It is chiefly to be found among the tall trees, in
the vicinity of dwellings, where it seems to delight to stay, and from their
highest tops to suspend its pensile nest. It is especially abundant among
the elms on Boston Common, where at almost any hour of the day, from
early in the month of May until long after summer has gone, may be heard
the prolonged notes of this, one of the sweetest and most constant of our
singers. Its voice is not powerful, but its melody is flute-like and tender.
Throughout the last of May, and in June and July, their charming song may
be heard amid the din of the city from earliest dawn till nightfall, and rarely
ceases even in the noontide heat, when all other birds are silent. It is ever
in motion, while thus singing; and its sweetest notes are given forth as it
moves among the tree-tops in search of insects. It is not only one of our
most constant singers, but it remains musical almost until its departure for
the South in October.</p>

<p>The Warbling Vireo appears in the Middle States about the 15th of April,
<!--431.png--><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 370]</span>
and reaches New England early in May. The path of its northern migrations,
and of its return, is somewhat in doubt. It is abundant in winter,
according to Sumichrast, about Orizaba, and probably enters Texas and
passes north and east along the Mississippi and the Ohio Rivers. In certain
portions of the country this species is evidently on the increase, becoming
more and more common as the country is settled, and towns and villages
spring up.</p>

<p>The Warbling Vireo builds its nest usually in more elevated positions than
any others of this family. For the most part in the vicinity of dwellings,
often over frequented streets, they suspend their elaborately woven and beautiful
little basket-like nest, secure from intrusion from their human neighbors,
and protected by the near presence of man from all their more dreaded enemies.
Audubon narrates, in an interesting manner, the building of their nest
by a pair of these birds on a poplar-tree, near his window, in Camden, <abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr>
It was suspended between the body of the tree and a branch coming out at
an acute angle. The pair were at work, morning and evening, eight days,
first attaching slender blades of grass to the knots on the branch and the
bark of the trunk, and thence working downward and outward. They varied
their materials, from time to time, until at last he traced them, after a prolonged
absence, to a distant haystack, from which they brought fine, slender,
dry grasses, with which they completed and lined their nest.</p>

<p>The nests of the Warbling Vireo, while they resemble closely those of the
other species in all the characteristics of this well-marked family, are yet, as a
rule, more carefully, neatly, and closely built. They are usually suspended at
the height of from thirty to fifty feet, in the fork of twigs, under and near the
extremity of the tree-top, often an elm, protected from the sun and storm
by a canopy of leaves, and quite out of reach of most enemies. They vary
little in size, being about two inches in height and three and a half in their
greatest diameter, narrowing, toward their junction with the twigs, to two
inches. They are all secured in a very firm manner to the twigs from which
they are suspended by a felting of various materials, chiefly soft, flexible,
flax-like strips of vegetable fibres, leaves, stems of plants, and strips of bark.
With these are interwoven, and carried out around the outer portions of the
nest, long strips of soft flexible bark of deciduous trees. They are softly and
compactly filled in and lined with fine stems of plants.</p>

<p>The eggs are usually five in number, and, like those of all the Vireos, are
of a brilliant crystal-white, sparingly spotted at the larger end with markings
of dark brown, and others of a lighter shade. They are less marked with
spots than usual in the genus, and are often entirely unspotted, and pure
white. Occasionally, however, they are found with well-marked blotches
of reddish-brown. They vary in length from .75 to .70 of an inch, and
average about .55 in their breadth.</p>

<p>In the present bird the bill is darker in color, much smaller, and more
depressed, the depth at the base being less than the width, instead of being
equal to it as in <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gilvus</i>. The wing is more rounded, the second quill

are weaker, and the colors generally paler and grayer. The iris, according to
Coues, is dark brown.</p>

<p>Young birds in autumnal plumage have the crown decidedly ash, the sides
more greenish; the wing-coverts pass terminally into a light brownish tint,
producing an inconspicuous band.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This Western representative of the Warbling Vireo is found
throughout the western portions of our Union, from the Great Plains to the
Pacific, and from Arizona to the extreme northern boundary of Washington
Territory.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper characterizes this as a lively and familiar songster. It arrives,
he states, at San Diego about April 10, and reaches Puget Sound toward the
middle of May, occupying nearly all the intermediate country throughout
the summer. It frequents the deciduous trees along the borders of streams
and prairies, coming into gardens and orchards with familiar confidence,
wherever cultivation has reclaimed the wilderness. Like its Eastern prototype,
its cheerful and varied song is heard all day long until quite late in the
autumn. They too build their nests in the shade-trees of the parks of busy
cities, singing ever their delightful strains, unconscious of the busy and noisy
crowd that throngs the neighboring streets.</p>

<p><!--433.png--><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 372]</span>
Dr. Cooper states that its nests are pendent from the forks of a branch
high above the ground, sometimes to the height of a hundred feet.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway, who observed the habits of this species in Utah and Nevada,
speaks of it as the characteristic Vireo of the West. It was found by
him in all the fertile localities, and was one of the most common birds in the
wooded regions. He found it very generally distributed through the summer,
inhabiting the copses along the streams of the mountain cañons, and
the open groves of the parks, as well as the cottonwoods and willows of the
river valleys. In the fall the berries of a species of the cornel that grows
along the mountain streams constitute its principal food. Its notes and manners
are identical with those of the Eastern species.</p>

<p>The nests of this species are not distinguishable, except in the necessarily
varying materials, from those of the Eastern birds. In position, size, and shape
they are the same. The eggs, four or five in number, are white, spotted with
brown and reddish-brown, and measure .78 by .58 of an inch. The spots are
somewhat darker than those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. gilvus</i>, and the shape more of an oblong-oval,
in all that I have seen. But this difference may disappear in the
examination of a larger number.</p>

<p>A nest found by Mr. Ridgway near Fort Churchill, Nevada, June 24, was
suspended from the extremity of a twig of a sapling of the cottonwood,
in a copse of the same growing in a river-bottom. It has a height of two
and a half inches, and a diameter of three. It is composed externally of
an elaborate interweaving of spiders’-webs, willow and cottonwood down,
and strong cord-like strips of fine inner bark. These are strongly bound
around the twigs from which the nest is suspended. It is one of the most
elaborately interwoven, homogeneous, and well-felted nests of this bird I
have ever met with. Another nest, from Parley’s Park, Utah, obtained June
28, differs in having the external portion woven almost exclusively of fine
strips of bleached bark, and is lined with fine wiry grasses. In each of these
the eggs were four in number, all oblong-oval in shape, but much more
pointed at one end in the latter nest.</p>

<p>This species was found breeding in Napa Valley, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, by Mr. A. J. Grayson,
and at Fort Tejon by Mr. Xantus.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Solitary Vireo appears to be found, irregularly, throughout
the United States. Nowhere abundant, so far as I am aware, it seems to be
more common in California than on the Atlantic, while there are also large
tracks of intervening territory in which we have no knowledge of its presence.
On the Atlantic it has been met with from Georgia to the Bay of
Fundy. In Massachusetts it has been found in a few restricted localities;
in one or two of them, they are as abundant as the White-eyed. Mr. Dresser
found it in Texas, near San Antonio, late in the autumn, and early in
spring, but none remained to breed. Mr. Boardman gives them as a summer
visitant at Calais, but not common, and Professor Verrill makes a similar
statement for Western Maine, where it arrives in the second week of May.
According to Mr. Allen, it reaches Western Massachusetts by May 1,
but it is there quite rare. A few are presumed to stop and breed.</p>

<p>In California, Mr. Gambel states that it is quite abundant in the latter
part of summer, and throughout the winter, frequenting low bushes and
thickets. Dr. Heermann also frequently met with it. Both at the East and
the West it is undoubtedly only migratory to about the 40th parallel, and
does not, except in mountainous localities, breed south of that line. Professor
Baird found it breeding in the South Mountains, near Carlisle, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>,
in May, 1844. It occurs in Guatemala in the winter.</p>

<p><!--436.png--><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 375]</span>
Dr. Cooper states that it reaches Puget Sound by the first of May, and he
has also observed it in the Colorado Valley, after the 14th, where they made
themselves conspicuous by their song, but in a few days had all passed
northward. He has met them nesting in May at the eastern base of the
Coast Range, and has also found them quite common, in summer, on the
Columbia River. Their favorite resorts are the deciduous oaks.</p>

<p>These birds were found breeding at Fort Tejon by Mr. Xantus, and at
Vancouver by Mr. Hepburn.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway met with a few in September, in the thickets along the
streams flowing from the Clover Mountains.</p>

<p>This species was taken in winter by Mr. Boucard, at Talew, in the State
of Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon’s statement that this bird is rather abundant, and that it
breeds in Louisiana, is undoubtedly incorrect, and his description of its nest
and eggs belongs rather to the Yellow-throated, and agrees with none that
I have ever seen of this species. That he found them abundant in Maine,
and traced them as far north as Pictou, Nova Scotia, is more probable. Dr.
Bachman speaks of this species becoming each year more abundant in South
Carolina, coming in February and remaining through March.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall, who met with this species on the Columbia, about the beginning
of May, describes its song as a plaintive, deliberate warble, intermediate
between the song of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">olivaceus</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flavifrons</i>. Mr. Burroughs
describes the love-notes of these birds as being inexpressibly sweet and tender
in both sexes. The song of the male, as I have heard it, bears no resemblance
to that of any other Vireo. It is a prolonged and very peculiar ditty,
repeated at frequent intervals and always identical. It begins with a lively
and pleasant warble, of a gradually ascending scale, which at a certain pitch
suddenly breaks down into a falsetto note. The song then rises again in a
single high note, and ceases. For several summers the same bird has been
heard, near my house in Hingham, in a wild pasture, on the edge of a wood,
always singing the same singular refrain, during the month of June.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall found a nest of this species suspended from the forked twig
of a wild crab-tree, about ten feet from the ground. The chief materials
were dead and withered grasses, with some cobwebs agglutinated together,
externally partially covered with a few shreds of hypnum, assimilating it
to the branch on which it hung, intermingled with a few white paper-like
capsules of the spiders’ nests, and lined with a few blades of grass and
slender root-fibres.</p>

<p>Seven nests of this species, found in Lynn and Hingham, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, exhibit
peculiarities of structure substantially identical. In comparison with the
nests of other Vireos, they are all loosely constructed, and seem to be not so
securely fastened to the twigs, from which they are suspended. One of these
nests, typical of the general character, obtained in Lynn, May 27, 1859, by
Mr. George O. Welch, was suspended from the branches of a young oak,
<!--437.png--><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 376]</span>
about twelve feet from the ground. The external depth of this nest was
only two and a half inches, the diameter three and a quarter, and its cavity
one and three quarters inches deep, and two inches wide at the rim. It was
constructed externally of strips of yellow and of gray birch-bark, intermingled
with bits of wool and dry grasses. The external portion was quite
loosely put together, but was lined, in a more compact manner, with dry
leaves of the white pine, arranged in layers. Another nest, found in Hingham,
was but two feet from the ground, on a branch of a hickory sapling.
In its general structure it was the same, only differing in shape, being made
to conform to its position, and being twice as long as it was broad. It contained
four young, when found, about the 10th of June. One nest alone,
built on a bush in Lynn, exhibits even an average degree of compactness in
its external structure. This is largely composed of cocoons, which are
woven together into a somewhat homogeneous and cloth-like substance.
Within, decayed stems of grasses take the place of the usual
pine-needles.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1870 a pair built their nest in a dwarf pear-tree, within
a few rods of my house. They were at first very shy and would not permit
themselves to be seen at their work, and suspended all labor when any one
was occupied near their chosen tree. Soon after the construction of the nest
two Cowbird’s eggs were deposited, which I removed, although the female
only laid two of her own before she began to sit upon them. By this time
she became more familiar, and would not leave her nest unless I attempted
to lay hands upon her. She made no complaints in the manner of the
White-eyed, nor sought to attack like the Yellow-throated, but kept within
a few feet, and watched me with eager eyes, until I left her. Unfortunately,
her nest was pillaged by a Black-billed Cuckoo, and I was unable to observe
her feed her young, as I had hoped to do.</p>

<p>The eggs are of an oblong-oval shape, moderately pointed at one end, and
of a white ground, less crystalline than in the other species of its kind. They
are spotted pretty uniformly over the entire egg with dots of dark red and
reddish-brown. They are usually five in number.</p>

<p>Since the type of this variety was obtained, two other specimens (Nos.
53,418 <abbr title="female symbol">♀</abbr> and 53,419 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, September, 1867; R. Ridgway) have been secured
by the United States Geological Survey of the 40th Parallel, in command of
Mr. Clarence King, in the West Humboldt Mountains, Nevada. These
specimens are even more different from true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solitarius</i> than is the type of this
race, showing that it is really distinct, as a variety. In the same thickets
at the same season, perfectly typical specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. solitarius</i> were obtained;
the latter having, no doubt, come from their more northern summer home
on their passage southward into Mexico.</p>

<p>In the Humboldt Mountain specimens the crown shows no trace of ash,
and is even darker and more brownish than the back. In fact, the relation
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. cassini</i> to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. solitaria</i> is an almost exact parallel to that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V.

being widely different, but connected by specimens showing intermediate
characters.</p>

<p>Nothing is known of the habits of this race.</p>

Southern Rocky Mountains; East Humboldt Mountains, Nevada (<span class="sc">Ridgway</span>).
In winter to Colima, Mexico.</p>

<p>While the pattern of coloration is precisely similar to that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lanivireo
solitarius</i>, the difference in the colors appears to be occasioned merely by removing,
as it were, the yellow stain, which on the plumbeous produces the
olive-green tinge, and exists in a purer tint along the sides, leaving, essentially,
only clear plumbeous and pure white; there is, however, in the most typical
specimens, always a faint tinge of green on the rump, and a stain of yellow
along the side. Though identical with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solitarius</i> in most of its proportions,
the wings and tail are considerably longer than in the average of that form.</p>

<p>There are many specimens from the Rocky Mountains and westward that
are so decidedly intermediate between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solitarius</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plumbeus</i>, that, considering
also the lack of essential difference in form and coloration between the
two, we do not hesitate to consider them, along with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cassini</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">propinquus</i>
(see <a href="#Page_373">page 373</a>), as races of a single species, of which each is the representative
in a particular region. Thus, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. solitarius</i> breeds in the Eastern Province
of the United States (and possibly in the Western, following the same
route far to the northward that many Eastern birds pursue in straggling
westward), and migrates in winter into Middle America as far as Guatemala;
those which breed in the Northwest pass directly southward, thus crossing the
region where <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cassini</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plumbeus</i> breed, which accounts for their being obtained
together. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. cassini</i> is the representative on the opposite side of the
continent; but the history of its migrations is yet obscure. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. plumbeus</i> is
the Middle Province and Rocky Mountain representative, breeding alone in
that region, and in winter migrating southward through Western Mexico as
far as Colima. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. propinquus</i> is another permanent race, but a local one, being
resident in the country where found, though mixed in winter with visitors
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solitarius</i> from the North.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Of this very recently discovered race, very little is at present
known. It was first described by Dr. Coues, who met with it in Arizona,
near Fort Whipple. He says it is especially abundant in the northern part
of that Territory. It was by far the most common Vireo at Fort Whipple,
where it is a summer resident, arriving there about the 15th of April and
remaining until October.</p>

<p>It was found to be common about Laramie Peak, by Dr. R. Hitz, and was
also met with in winter on the plains at Colima, Mexico, by Xantus.</p>

<p>It was seen in the summers of 1868 and 1869, by Mr. Ridgway, among
the cedar and nut-pine woods on the slopes and among the brushwood in the
cañons of the East Humboldt Mountains, being most partial to the former
situations. There, too, it undoubtedly breeds, as in the latter part of July
young birds, unable to fly, were met with by him. He also states that the
<!--440.png--><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 379]</span>
common notes of this Vireo very closely resemble those of the Western Wood
Wren (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Troglodytes parkmanni</i>).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> All the older ornithological writers, in speaking of the Yellow-throated
Vireo, repeat each other in describing it as peculiarly attracted to
the forest, seeking its solitudes and gleaning its food chiefly among its topmost
branches. Such has not been my experience with this interesting and
attractive little songster. I have found no one of this genus, not even the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gilva</i>, so common in the vicinity of dwellings, or more familiar and fearless
in its intercourse with man. All of its nests that I have ever met with have
been built in gardens and orchards, and in close proximity to dwellings, and
they have also been exclusively in comparatively low positions. In one of
the most recent instances a pair of these birds built one of their beautiful
moss-covered nests in a low branch of an apple-tree that overhung the croquet-ground,
within a few rods of my house. It was first noticed in consequence
<!--441.png--><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 380]</span>
of its bold little builder flying in my face whenever I approached too
near, even before its nest contained any eggs. The grounds were in frequent
use, and the pair were at first a good deal disturbed by these constant intrusions,
but they soon became reconciled to their company, and would not leave
their position, even though the game was contested immediately under their
nest, which was thus often brought within a foot of the heads of the players.
Before this nest was quite finished, the female began her duties of incubation.
Her assiduous mate was constantly engaged at first in completing the external
ornamentation of the nest with lichens and mosses, and then with a
renewal of his interrupted concerts of song. These duties he varied by
frequent captures of insects, winged and creeping, most of which he duly
carried to his mate. His song was varied, sweet, and touchingly beautiful.
Less powerful than the notes of several others of its family, except those of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Warbling</i>, I know of none more charming.</p>

<p>These birds reach New England about the 10th of May, and usually have
their nests constructed early in June. Their habits, in all essential respects,
are the same as those of all its family. They are somewhat confiding and
trustful of man, are readily approached, and soon become so well acquainted
with those among whom they have a home as to fearlessly come to the windows
of the house in pursuit of spiders or flies, and even to enter them. In
the latter case they cannot readily make their exit, and soon lose their self-possession,
beating their heads against the walls and ceiling in vain attempts
to get out, unless caught and released. In one instance a young bird, that
had entered my barn-chamber, became so entangled in cobwebs, around his
wings and feet, as to be unable to escape again. When taken in the hand,
and his meshes one by one picked out from about his feet and quills, he
was very docile, made no resistance or outcry, nor any attempt to escape,
until he was entirely freed from his bonds, although it required some time
and care to accomplish it. When entirely freed from these clogs, and permitted
to go, he flew away very deliberately to a short distance, and occupied
himself with dressing his disordered plumage.</p>

<p>The nest of this species is also a pendent structure, and hemispherical in
shape. It may always be readily distinguished from any other nest of this
family by the profusion of lichens and mosses with which its outer portion
is adorned and covered, giving it the appearance of a large
moss-covered
knot.</p>

<p>In most of the towns in the vicinity of Boston this species, though not
abundant, is quite common. Their nests, built usually in low and rather
conspicuous positions for birds of this kind, occur most frequently in gardens
and orchards. One of these, found suspended from a moss-covered branch
of an apple-tree in Roxbury, may be taken as typical of its kind. Its
rim was firmly bound around the fork of a branch by a continuation of the
materials that form the outside of the nest itself. These are an interweaving
of spiders’-webs, and silky threads from insect cocoons, largely intermingled
<!--442.png--><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 381]</span>
with mosses and lichens, and thus made to conform closely in appearance to
the moss-grown bark of the tree. The under portion of the nest is strengthened
by long strips of the inner bark of the wild grape. Within is an
inner nest made of fine grassy stems and bark. It forms exactly a half-sphere
in shape, is symmetrical, and is very thoroughly made. Its diameter
is four, and its height two and one fourth inches.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall describes a nest of this bird, found by him suspended from the
forked twig of an oak, near a dwelling-house, as coated over with green
lichens, attached very artfully by a slender string of caterpillars’ silk, the
whole afterwards tied over by almost invisible threads of the same, so nicely
done as to appear to be glued on. The whole fabric was thus made to resemble
an accidental knot of the tree, grown over with moss. Another nest,
observed by the same writer, was fixed on the depending branches of a wild
cherry, and was fifty feet from the ground. So lofty a position as this is
probably very unusual. I have never met with any higher than ten feet
from the ground.</p>

<p>The food of this Vireo is chiefly insects, and in the breeding-season is
altogether so. Later in the season they mingle with these various kinds of
small berries.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species vary from .95 to .88 of an inch in length, and
from .65 to .60 in breadth. Their ground-color is white, often with a very
perceptible tint of roseate when fresh. In this respect they differ in a very
marked manner from the eggs of any other of this genus, except, perhaps,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">barbatula</i>, and may thus always be very easily recognized. They are
more or less boldly marked with blotches of a dark roseate-brown, also peculiar
to the eggs of this species, though varying greatly in their size and
depth of color.</p>

<p>This Vireo winters, in great numbers, in Central America, and was largely
represented in the collection of Dr. Van Patten from Guatemala. It was
also found at Pirico, in Colombia, South America, by Mr. C. W. Wyatt.
It occurs in abundance as far to the west as Grinnell, Iowa, where Mr.
W. H. Parker found it to be a very common summer resident.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Southern border of Western Texas; Mazatlan.</p>

<p>The black head of this species, as far as known, makes it unique in the
genus. It is extremely rare, but three or four specimens being known.</p>

<p>We refer to this species a specimen&mdash;probably a female&mdash;obtained at
Mazatlan, on the western coast of Mexico, in April, by Colonel Grayson (<abbr title="Smithsonian Institution, Number">S.
I., No.</abbr> 55,046). This specimen differs from those from Texas in having the
black of the head replaced by a dull dark slate-color, the olive above rather
less virescent, and the lower parts not pure white, but somewhat buffy. As
all the other essential characters are identical, there being in both the
white space covering the whole lore, and orbital ring interrupted on top,&mdash;features
not seen in any other species,&mdash;we have little hesitation in considering
them the same species; which opinion is moreover strengthened by
the fact, that among the Texas specimens, all with black caps, there are
no females.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Of the general history and habits of this rare species very little
is known. It was first met with by Dr. Woodhouse, on the 26th of May,
1851, in Western Texas. This was on the Rio San Pedro, within ten miles
of its source. He found it among some cedars, and was attracted by its very
singular notes. It was in continual motion, like a Wood Warbler, and was
by him at first supposed to be one of those birds. He obtained two specimens,
both of which proved to be males.</p>

<p>Mr. John H. Clark, the naturalist of the Mexican Boundary Commission,
likewise found this species in Texas, and not far from the same locality in
which it was discovered by Dr. Woodhouse. His attention also was drawn
to the bird by its shrill discordant chirp, which it uttered incessantly in its
pursuit of insects. Three specimens only were seen, and all of them at one
locality, the valley of the Rio San Pedro, to which it seemed to be confined.
It was not at all shy, and showed no concern when Mr. Clark approached
within a few rods. Its constant motion, hopping incessantly from branch
to branch, made it a matter of some difficulty to procure specimens. It
was found in June, and the single specimen shot by Mr. Clark was also a
male.</p>

Beneath white; the chin and lower cheeks with a grayish tinge; the sides of breast and
body, with axillars and base of crissum (more faintly), bright yellow; the inner wing-coverts
and rest of crissum much paler, almost white. A broad yellow line from nostrils
to and continuous with a yellow ring round the eye, which is encircled exteriorly by
olivaceous; a dusky loral, but no post-ocular spot. Wings with two covert-bands and
innermost secondaries externally, broadly yellowish-white; rest of quills edged externally
with olive, except the two outer and tips of other primaries, which are grayish. Rectrices
edged externally with olive, except outermost, which is bordered by grayish. All the long
quills bordered internally by whitish. Bill blue-black, paler on the edges; legs dark
plumbeous. Iris white. Total length, 4.90; wing, 2.40; tail, 2.20.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
United States, west to base of Rocky Mountains; south to Guatemala; Bogota?
Very rare in Cuba. Abundant and resident in the Bermudas.</p>

<p>Specimens vary slightly in a greater amount of ashy on the head, and less
brilliancy of the yellow of head and sides. Sometimes there is a decided
ashy shade in the white of throat and jugulum, which again has a very faint
tinge of yellowish.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The White-eyed Vireo is one of the most common and one of
the most widely diffused of its genus in all parts of the United States east
of the Rocky Mountains. It apparently breeds in all parts of the Union,
from Texas and the Indian Territory on the southwest to Iowa and Wisconsin,
and as far to the northeast as Massachusetts. In the last-named State
it becomes exceedingly rare, and beyond it is apparently not found, none
having been met with either by Messrs. Verrill or Boardman in any part of
Maine. In Western Massachusetts it was not found by Mr. Allen, though
it occurs in the eastern part, along the coast. Mr. Dresser found it common
in Western Texas, many remaining there to breed, and Dr. Woodhouse also
found it abundant in Texas, New Mexico, and the Indian Territory, where
it frequented the thickets bordering on the streams. It breeds abundantly
in the Northwest States of Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. It also breeds in
the islands of Bermuda.</p>

<p><!--447.png--><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 386]</span>
In the winter months this species retires to the more southern States, and
to Mexico and Central and South America, though Sumichrast does not give
it as occurring in the Department of Vera Cruz. Nuttall found it in South
Carolina in the middle of January, and Wilson met with them in full song in
Georgia in February. The fact that it was seven weeks after this before they
made their appearance in Pennsylvania is given by that writer as evidence
of the gradual progression made by this species in its movements northward,
regulated by the development of the season. Audubon, however, states the
first of March as about the time of its first appearance in Louisiana. He
also mentions that this species is a constant resident in the Floridas during
winter, and also in the lower portions of Alabama and Georgia. A
large number also pass farther south, as is shown by the abundance of the
arrivals in early spring on the coast of Texas. Mr. Audubon states also
that Townsend met with them on the Columbia River, and that he himself
found them along the coast in Maine, Nova Scotia, and Labrador. This,
however, I am inclined to consider a misstatement, as they have not since
been detected either west of Dakota or north of the <abbr title="forty-second">42d</abbr> parallel.</p>

<p>This Vireo is one of the most conspicuous singers of this family. Its
songs are more earnest and louder than those of any of our Eastern species,
and exhibit the greatest variations, beginning in the earlier part of the season
with a simple low whistle, but changing in May into a very quaint and
peculiar succession of irregular notes. Some of these are very softly and
sweetly whistled, while others are uttered with a vehemence and shrillness
that seem hardly possible in so small a bird.</p>

<p>This is an unsuspecting and familiar bird, permitting a near approach, and
when whistled to will often stop and eye you with marked curiosity, and
even approach a little nearer, as if to obtain a better view, entirely unconscious
of any danger. This is not so, however, when they have a nest. On
this occasion they exhibit great uneasiness when their nest is visited, approaching
very near to the intruder, looking down upon him with marked
expressions of uneasiness, and scolding all the while with great earnestness,
and with a hoarse mewing that is very peculiar. This display is
continued even after the fledglings are full grown and able to take care of
themselves.</p>

<p>The food of this species in early summer is almost exclusively small insects,
which it gleans with great assiduity. In Eastern Massachusetts, like
all its kindred, it feeds eagerly upon the young larvæ of the destructive
canker-worm, and doubtless, in the wilder portions of the country, is of considerable
service in restricting the increase of this scourge.</p>

<p>The White-eyed Vireo may usually be found in wild, swampy, open
grounds, near the edges of woods, and where there are small thickets of
smilax and other briers and wild vines, in the midst of which it often builds
its pensile nest. These nests are rarely, if ever, more than three or four feet
from the ground. Two nests of this bird, one from Neosho Falls, Kansas,
<!--448.png--><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 387]</span>
the other from Lynn, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, may be taken as characteristic of the species.
They are almost exactly hemispherical in shape, their height and diameter
being the same,&mdash;three inches. They were suspended from low bushes,
hanging from the extreme ends of the twigs, among which the nests were
fastened by fine impacted masses of wood-mosses, which are very nicely and
elaborately interwoven with the lower portions of the outer covering of the
nest. The latter is composed of a singular medley of various materials,
among which may be noticed broken fragments of dry leaves, bits of decayed
wood and bark, coarse blades of grass, various vegetable fibres, lichens,
fragments of insects, mosses, straws, stems, etc. These are all wrapped round
and firmly bound together with strong hempen fibres of vegetables. Within
this outer envelope is an inner nest, made of the finer stems of grasses
and dry needles of the white pine, firmly interwoven. For the size of the
bird, these nests are proportionally larger and deeper than any others of the
common kinds. The cavity is two or two and a half inches deep.</p>

<p>The eggs are usually five in number. One from Georgia measures .77 by
.55 of an inch, and is of an oblong-oval shape; another, from Massachusetts,
is much more broadly ovate, measuring .80 by .62. Their greatest breadth
is .65 of an inch, and their length .80. They have a clear
crystal-white
ground, spotted about the larger end with fine dark-purple and reddish-brown
dots.</p>

<p>This species is one of the most common foster-parents of the Cowbird,
the eggs of which are always tenderly cared for, and the offspring nurtured
by them, always to the destruction of their own nestlings.</p>

<p>The description just given is based upon the type specimen, probably in
winter plumage. Spring specimens do not vary materially except in greater
purity of white edgings of the feathers. Two Mexican specimens are rather
larger, the wing measuring 2.50, the tail 2.30. No other differences are
appreciable. In general the first primary is about half the second, sometimes
rather less.</p>

<p>This species is readily distinguished from other Vireos, excepting <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V.
modestus</i>, which it greatly resembles in the small bill, form, coloration, and
size; nor indeed is it easy to separate them. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modestus</i>, however, the
first quill is usually more than half the second, not less; the wing shorter,
and less pointed; the tail longer. The upper parts are more uniform, not
much brighter towards rump.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species is one of comparatively recent origin, and of its history
but little is as yet known. It was first described by Cassin, in 1851, from
a specimen obtained in Monterey, <abbr title="California One">Cal. I</abbr>t has been found in various parts
of California, in the valley of the Gila, and in the northern and eastern portions
of Mexico. Mr. Sumichrast gives it as a resident of the alpine region
of the Department of Vera Cruz.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper has observed this bird near San Diego, late in February, where
he at first mistook it for the Ruby-crowned Wren, a bird that winters there
in abundance, and which he states resembles this species closely in appearance
and habits. Two of them came to within a few feet of where he sat,
scolding in a harsh tone. He recognized then their larger size and different
plumage, as well as their remarkably large eyes, and a peculiar slowness and
deliberation in their movements as they searched the foliage for insects.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper has since found them wintering plentifully up to latitude 38<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>.
Having observed but few of them in the Coast Range, in May, he thinks that
most of them go farther north in summer. At San Diego, however, he shot
a female, on the 9th of March, containing an egg nearly ready to be laid.
He had not been able to find the nest, which is presumed to be built in the
dense shade of the evergreen oaks (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quercus agrifolia</i>). Their song is said to
consist of a few short and quaint notes. Among the memoranda of Mr.
Xantus, made at Fort Tejon, I find the following: (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1,827.) Nest and

trees, suspended from three high stems of weeds, fastened to them, but very

description of nest or eggs.</p>

Mexico (October, <span class="sc">Sumichrast</span>); Missouri (<span class="sc">Hoy</span>); Iowa (<span class="sc">Allen</span>); Southeast Illinois
(<span class="sc">Ridgway</span>).</p>

<p>The above description is taken from a type specimen received from Mr.
Audubon, and represents the average spring plumage. Autumnal skins are
rather brighter, and there is occasionally an ochraceous tinge on the white
of the under parts.</p>

<p>This species at first sight appears like a miniature of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. gilvus</i>, the head
being almost exactly similar. The back is, however, much brighter olive,
the sides and crissum deeper yellow. The superciliary light stripe is shorter.
The white markings of the wings are wanting in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gilvus</i>. The wing, tail, and
feet are entirely different in their proportions.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species was first procured by Mr. Audubon’s party in the
excursion to the Yellowstone River, in what is now known as Dakota Territory.

In his account of it Mr. Audubon states that it is usually found in
the bottom-lands along the shores of the Upper Missouri River, from the
neighborhood of the Black Snake Hills, as far as they ascended that river. In
its habits he describes it as more nearly allied to the White-eyed Vireo than
any other.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse, in his report of the Zuñi River Expedition, mentions finding
this species abundant in Texas. Mr. Dresser also speaks of it as not
uncommon, during the summer, near San Antonio, and remaining there to
breed. He mentions finding a nest on the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> of July in a <cite>wesatche</cite> bush
near the San Pedro, containing three eggs of this species and one of the Cow-Bunting.
Being anxious to procure the parent bird he left it, but on his
return the nest had been torn and the Vireo’s eggs smashed. Dr. Heermann
found a nest on the Medina about the same time. He describes this nest as
beautifully formed of fine grasses, and hung from the small twigs of a tree.
The eggs, four in number, were very small, white, with an occasional reddish
dot at the larger end. The nest found by Dr. Heermann was attached to the
pendent twigs of a willow. The stomachs of these Vireos were found to
contain small green caterpillars.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues met with this species near Fort Riley, May 23. It appeared to
be quite common, and was found inhabiting thickets and clumps of bushes,
like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. noveboracensis</i>, but having a very different song, the peculiarity of
which first attracted his attention. Mr. Ridgway found it to be a common
summer resident in the thickets and copses of Southern Illinois, especially in
the prairie districts. He first met with it on the 8th of June, 1871, on Fox
Prairie, in Richland County. His attention was drawn to it by its peculiar
song, which has a general resemblance to that of the White-eyed Vireo, having
the same odd delivery, but being more sputtering, reminding one somewhat
of the song of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Troglodytes ædon</i>.</p>

<p>This Vireo appears to have quite an extended distribution during the
breeding-season, or from Texas to the Upper Missouri, and even as far as the
eastern edge of Southern Illinois. It breeds also as far to the east as Eastern
Kansas. Its western limits are not so clearly defined. It was not found
by Mr. Ridgway in Nevada or Utah, nor by Dr. Coues in Arizona.</p>

<p>A nest of this species, found in June, near Neosho Falls, Kansas, by Mr.
B. F. Goss (<abbr title="Smithsonian Institution Collection">S. I. Coll.</abbr>, 1,875), is pensile; suspended from two small twigs, which
make the basis of three fourths of its rim. Over these is strongly bound
a finely felted webbing of the flax-like fibres of plants, interwoven with
slender stems. With these are connected and interwoven also the materials
that make up the periphery of the nest itself. This is composed of long
and slender strips of bark, fragments of dry leaves, bits of wood, and various
other fragmentary substances. The nest, unlike others of this family, is
lined with down, and the fine long hair of some animals, instead of with
vegetable stems. The diameter as well as the height of this nest is about
two and a half inches.</p>

<p><!--452.png--><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 391]</span>
Another nest from West Texas, obtained by Captain Pope, is essentially
different in its general characteristics. It is three inches in diameter,
and but one inch and three quarters high. The opening is circular, but
only one and a half inches wide. Below the rim the cavity widens until it
is two and a half inches in diameter. The outer nest is made up of an
interweaving of fine strips of bark and dry leaves, intermixed with and
firmly bound around by strong flax-like fibres of different plants. Within,
it is lined with fine flexible grasses and stems of plants.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are from .73 to .76 of an inch in length, and from
.52 to .56 in breadth. They are pure white, sparingly spotted with fine red
dots distributed around the larger end.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Least Vireo is a recently described species of its genus, and
one in regard to whose history comparatively little has been ascertained. It
was first met with at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas by Mr. Xantus, and described by Dr.
Coues in 1866. Dr. Coues assigns as its habitat Lower and Southern California,
Sonora, and Arizona, at least as far north as Fort Whipple. Dr.
Cooper also found it at Fort Mohave. Dr. Coues met with it fifty miles south
of Fort Whipple, where he found it breeding abundantly. He gives no information
in regard to its habits. Dr. Cooper states that he found it rather
common along the upper part of Mohave River, in June, 1861; and in the
following spring, about April 20, they began to arrive at San Diego in considerable
numbers. In its habits Dr. Cooper thinks it greatly resembles <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V.
gilvus</i>, though it differs entirely in its song. The notes of those that he heard
singing resembled very much those of the Polioptilas uttering a quaint mixture
of the notes of the Wrens, Swallows, and Vireos. They also seem to
possess more or less of imitative powers. At Sacramento he saw and heard,
in the willows along the river, individuals which, from their peculiar notes,
he had no doubt were of this species, but he did not verify his conjectures.
His suppositions were confirmed later by the observations of Mr. Ridgway,
who states that he found these birds the most abundant as well as the most
characteristic Greenlet in the vicinity of Sacramento. It is a species, he
adds, easily recognized, being in all respects quite distinct from any other.
The character of its notes, as well as its habits, show it to be a true Vireo.
Its song, though weaker, bears a great resemblance to that of the White-eyed.
A nest of this species was found by him near Sacramento. It was placed
about three feet from the ground, in a low bush in a copse of willows. Like
all the nests of this genus it was pensile, being attached to and suspended
from the twigs of a branch.</p>

<p>Two nests of this interesting species were also obtained near Camp Grant,
Arizona, in 1867, by Dr. E. Palmer. They are wrought like all the nests of
this kind, below the small forked branches of a tree, suspended from the extremity
of its twigs. They each have a diameter of about three and a half
inches, a height of two, with a cavity an inch and a half deep and two wide.
The external portion, like the nests of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. belli</i>, is wrought with woven
hemp-like vegetable fibres, strongly bound around the ends of the twigs and
covering the entire exterior. Within this is placed a strong, firmly made
basket, composed of slender strips of bark and long, fine, and flexible pine-needles,
with a lining of finer materials of the same. In one of these nests
<!--454.png--><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 393]</span>
there were three eggs of the Vireo, and one of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molothrus</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obscurus?</i>). The
former were of a bright crystalline whiteness, marked with very minute and
hardly discernible spots of red, and measure .69 by .56 of an inch. The
egg of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molothrus</i>, except in its much smaller size, is hardly distinguishable
from those of the common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. pecoris</i>, and measures .75 by .56 of
an inch.</p>

<p>In the other nest were also three eggs of the Vireo. They correspond in
size, but are much more distinctly marked with larger spots of a dark red
and reddish-brown. In this nest there is a somewhat larger proportion of
fine strips of inner bark, and mixed with these are also a few silky insect
cocoons, by means of which the nest is firmly bound around the twigs from
which the whole is suspended.</p>

This species might at first sight be taken for a small specimen of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. plumbeus</i>,
the colors, character of bill, etc., being very similar, except that the white
of lores and around eye is much less distinct, the lore without any blackish
before the eye, and there is only one faint band on wing, instead of two conspicuous
ones; the tail-feathers, too, lack the distinct white edgings. The
much more rounded wing, and the first primary half the second or more,
will, however, readily distinguish them. The form of the bird is very much
that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. pusillus</i>, which it resembles considerably also in color. The outer
quill is, however, longer, the bill deeper and more compressed, the inner lateral
toe considerably shorter, and the size larger. The colors are purer, without
the olive of the back or the yellowish of the under parts; the bill, too,
is entirely dark plumbeous, instead of horn-color, whitish beneath. From
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. pallens</i> it is distinguished by a smaller, darker bill; longer tail and wing;
one wing-band, not two; and purer colors.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> In regard to the habits of this well-marked but very rare species
but little is as yet known. It was first described, in 1866, by Dr. Coues,
from a single specimen obtained by him near Fort Whipple, Arizona. It
was shot May 4, 1865, and is supposed by Dr. Coues to be a summer resident
of Arizona wintering in the Gila and the Lower Colorado Valleys, or in
Sonora.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Northern parts of Europe, America, and Asia. In America not hitherto found
in the Pacific Province. In winter extending along the Rocky Mountains and the Plains
as far south as Fort Massachusetts and Fort Riley; regular visitor to shores of Lake Michigan
and Lake Erie. East of this rarely seen along the United States border. Fort Mohave
(???) (<span class="sc">Cooper</span>).</p>

<p>The specimen seen by Dr. Cooper, at Fort Mohave, if really of this species,
fixes the most western locality on record.</p>

<p>For many years authentic eggs of the Bohemian Chatterer were greatly
sought after, but it was not until 1856 that any were brought to the notice
of the scientific world, when the late Mr. H. Wolley discovered them in
Lapland. Early duplicates from his collection were sold at five guineas each,
and although a good many have since been obtained, they are yet considered
as great prizes. A nest, with its eggs, of those collected by Mr. Wolley,
has been presented to the Smithsonian Institution by Mr. Alfred Newton.
The only instances on record of their discovery in America are of a nest and
one egg by Mr. Kennicott, on the Yukon, in 1861, and a nest and single egg
<!--461.png--><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 398]</span>
on the Anderson River, by Mr. MacFarlane, both of which, with the female
parents, are in the possession of the Institution. Although there is frequently
considerable difference between individuals, there appears to be no
difference between those from the two continents.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Waxwing is, in many respects, one of the most interesting
and remarkable of the birds of North America. The roving character of its
life, the mystery, still only imperfectly solved, of its habits and residence
during its breeding-season, and its somewhat cosmopolitan residence in Europe,
Asia, and America, impart to it an interest that attaches to but few
other species. Though not common in any portions of the United States,
and only appearing at all during midwinter, yet in the more northern States,
in which it is occasionally found, it moves in such large flocks, and is so
noticeable and conspicuous a bird, that it never fails to make a lasting impression,
and hardly seems to us so very rare as it undoubtedly is.</p>

<p>In a single instance, in midwinter, somewhere about 1844, during a severe
snow-storm, a large flock of these birds made their appearance in Boston, and
alighted on a large horse-chestnut tree that stood in an open and retired
place. There were at least twenty or thirty in the flock; they remained in
their shelter undisturbed for some time, and their true specific character
was plainly noticeable.</p>

<p>Several specimens were procured near Worcester, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, and given to Dr.
Bryant. Eleven individuals of this species were shot in Bolton by Mr. S.
Jillson, January, 1864, and others have since been noticed in Watertown by
Mr. William Brewster. They have also been obtained near Hartford, <abbr title="Connecticut">Conn.</abbr>,
by Dr. Wood.</p>

<p>Prior to this, as Mr. Audubon states, specimens had been procured near
Philadelphia, and in the winters of 1830 and 1832 several of these birds
were also shot on Long Island.</p>

<p>Mr. Boardman mentions that they are occasional, in winter, near Calais;
and Professor Verrill, who did not meet with it in Norway, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>, cites it as
accidental and rare in the State.</p>

<p>It is not common in the Arctic regions. Specimens of the bird were
obtained on Anderson River, in 1862, by Mr. MacFarlane, but he was not
able to find the nest. At Fort Yukon, July 4, Mr. Kennicott met with
the nest of this species. The nest, which contained but one egg, was about
eighteen feet from the ground, and was built on a side branch of a small
spruce that was growing at the outer edge of a clump of thick spruces, on
low ground. The nest was large, the base being made of small, dry spruce
twigs. Internally it was constructed of fine grass and moose-hair, and lined
thickly with large feathers. The female was shot, as she rose from her nest,
by Mr. Kennicott’s hunter, who had concealed himself near the spot for that
purpose. Mr. Kennicott had seen the nest and both parents near it before
it was taken, and had thoroughly satisfied himself as to its complete identification.</p>

<p><!--462.png--><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 399]</span>
Ross speaks of them as not rare throughout the district in which they
winter, but yet not numerous. He adds that at Great Bear Lake they are
very plentiful, and that they are reported to nest there. Mr. Dall states
that they were quite common at Nulato, where they did not arrive before
June 10, or later. He obtained a number of skins from the Indians, taken
in his absence. He adds that it breeds, and its eggs have been obtained at
Fort Yukon.</p>

<p>Except in a few instances, where Dr. Cooper noticed this species, in
September, at Fort Laramie, and also when he obtained an individual on
the Colorado, none of these birds have been seen west of the Rocky Mountains.
The bird obtained by Dr. Cooper was, in his opinion, a straggler from
some neighboring mountain. It made its appearance January 10, after a
period of stormy weather, and was shot while feeding on the berries of the
mistletoe.</p>

<p>This bird was first noticed in America, in the spring of 1826, near the
sources of the Athabasca River, by Mr. Drummond, and in the same season
by Sir John Richardson, at Great Bear Lake, latitude 65<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. In the latter
region he states that they appeared in flocks about the 24th of May. At
that time the spring thaw had exposed the berries of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arbutus</i> and the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vaccinium</i>, that had been covered during the winter. It stayed only a few
days, and none of the Indians knew where it bred, or had ever seen its nest.
Afterwards, early in May, 1827, Sir John Richardson saw a large flock of three
or four hundred individuals at Carlton House, on the Saskatchewan. They
all alighted in a grove of poplars, on one or two trees, making a loud twittering
noise. They stayed only about an hour in the morning, and were too
shy to be approached within gunshot.</p>

<p>In England they have been known to appear as early as August. They
are always shy, and not easily approached. In their activity and incessant
change of position and place, they are said to resemble the Titmice. They
feed on the berries of the mountain-ash, the hawthorn, and the ivy. They will
also feed on insects, catching them as dexterously as Flycatchers. Their call-note
is a single chirp, frequently repeated.</p>

<p>Mr. McCulloch, writing to Mr. Audubon, gives a touching account of the
devotion shown by one of these birds to its wounded mate. The latter had
been so crippled that it was hardly able to move. Its mate stationed itself
on the top of the tree in which it had sought shelter, and with great vehemence
continually uttered the notes <i class="birdcall">tzee-tzee</i>, in alarm and warning, and,
when danger approached, flew against it and urged it on to flight, and
stayed to share its fate, rather than leave its partner.</p>

<p>The nest and eggs of this species remained entirely unknown until the
spring of 1856, when the late Mr. John Wolley, an enthusiastic English
oölogist, first discovered them in Lapland. The season was unusually backward
and cold, and the nests contained their full complement by the 12th
of June. One of the nests, obtained in Finland, June 19, 1861 (<abbr title="Smithsonian Institution">S. I.</abbr>, 5,327),
<!--463.png--><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 400]</span>
contained five eggs. It is of remarkable size in proportion to that of its
builder, measuring eight inches in diameter. It is flattened in shape, and
its cavity, though large, is not deep. The height of the nest is three and a
quarter inches, and the depth of the base is fully two and a half inches. The
cavity is less than an inch deep, and is four inches in diameter. The base
and outer periphery of this nest are of a coarse interlacing of the small ends
of branches of fir and spruce trees. Within this is built a close, compact
inner nest, chiefly composed of a lichen peculiar to Arctic regions, called
tree-hair, which hangs abundantly from the branches of trees in northern
forests. It resembles a mass of delicate black rootlets. These are not uncommon
ingredients in the nests of northern birds, especially of European.
In America, Arctic nests of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. carolinensis</i> are occasionally built of similar
materials. With these lichens are also mingled fragments of dry leaves
and soft dark-colored mosses. The rim of the nest is strongly made, almost
exclusively of these fine dark-colored lichens. This kind of lichen is not
always black, but is often brown, and even whitish. In some of these
nests silvery fibres of grass-leaves are mingled with the lichens, and in one
or two there is a slight lining of feathers.</p>

<p>The Lapland nests were built on the branch of a tree, at a distance from
the trunk, and stood up from it unsupported by the surrounding twigs, and
at the height of from six to twelve feet from the ground. They were generally
much exposed, and were, for the most part, built in the more open portions
of the forests. The general number of the eggs was five, in one
instance it was six.</p>

<p>The nest from the Yukon, obtained by Mr. Kennicott (S. Coll., 6,326), is
smaller, and bears but little resemblance to the European. It is but five
inches in diameter, of irregular shape. In height and cavity it nearly corresponds.
In place of the lichens of the European, this nest is made of fine
grass-stems, strips of bark, and a few feathers.</p>

<p>The eggs of this bird, the gift of Mr. Wolley, measure an inch in length,
and from .70 to .67 of an inch in breadth. Their ground-color varies from a
light slate to a yellowish stone-color. They are marked, blotched, and dotted
with spots of various hues and size. These are chiefly of a dark purple, at
times approaching black. Mingled with these are markings of a yellowish-brown.
Nearly all these spots are surrounded by a peculiar penumbra, or
shading, such as forms so marked a feature in the eggs of the common
Cedar-Bird.</p>

<p>The egg obtained by Kennicott on the Yukon is smaller than the European
specimen, measuring .90 by .65 of an inch. Its ground is more of a
greenish-slate or stone-color, and the spots are of a dark brown, with a deep
violet shading.</p>

defined band of gamboge-yellow. A broad stripe of intense velvety-black on side of
head, starting from nostril, passing across lore, and involving the eye, continued from it
beneath the crest to the occiput; chin dull black, blending gradually into the brownish of
the throat. A narrow white line across the forehead and along side of crown, between
brown of crown and black of lore, etc., a narrow crescent on lower eyelid and a stripe
between black of lore and that of the throat, white. <i class="sex">Male</i> with each secondary quill terminated

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Whole of North America as far north as Lake Winnipeg and Hudson’s Bay, south
branch of Saskatchewan, latitude 52½<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> (<span class="sc">Richardson</span>); south to Guatemala; Jamaica and
Cuba in winter.</p>

<p>A specimen from Guatemala (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 50,455 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>) is almost identical with examples
from the United States, but differs in having a small spot of yellow
at the tip of each primary; also there are red appendages on the tip of a
few tail-feathers, as well as the longest feather of the lower
tail-coverts.
The colors, generally, are softer, the brown more purplish, and the ash finer
and more bluish, than in a fine spring male from Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>A specimen (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 53,396 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, Humboldt River, Nevada, September 10, 1868,
C. King, R. Ridgway) from the Middle Province of the United States, differs
considerably from any other in the collection. The colors are much
paler, the anterior portions being almost ochraceous, the whole abdomen
<!--465.png--><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 402]</span>
nearly white. The white band across the forehead is very broad; the extreme
point of the chin only black. Whether it is a representative of a style
peculiar to the Great Basin, or merely a bleached individual, cannot be decided
without additional specimens from the same region.</p>

<p>There is so much variation in different specimens in regard to the red wax-like
appendages, that the Guatemalan specimen mentioned above can hardly
be considered as more than a very highly developed individual.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The habits of the common Cedar-Bird are eminently nomadic,
and, so far as those of the Waxwing are known, correspond in all respects,
except in the more general and especially the more southern distribution of
the present species. They are found throughout North America at least so
far as the wooded country extends, and they breed from Florida to the Red
River country. They are a common bird in New England, and would be
much more so but that their fondness for cherries and other small fruits, and
their indifference to danger, makes them an easy and frequent mark for destruction.
Their unpopularity has caused their numbers to be greatly reduced
of late years in the thickly settled portions of the country.</p>

<p>In Southern Texas Mr. Dresser found these birds very common during the
winter at San Antonio and Eagle Pass, but he observed none later than the
middle of April. They were seen in Tamaulipas, by Lieutenant Couch, in
March, and afterwards in April at New Leon, Mexico. Sumichrast states that
these birds are found everywhere and in great abundance in winter throughout
Vera Cruz. They are there known as the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Chinito</i>, and are highly appreciated
by the Mexican epicures. They are equally abundant in northern
parts of South America, and also throughout Central America.</p>

<p>In Washington Territory and in Oregon Dr. Cooper speaks of them as less
common than in the Atlantic States, and he only met with a few, in single
pairs, in the summer. Townsend states that he found them in Oregon, but
Dr. Suckley never met with any west of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>In California Dr. Cooper has seen small flocks in winter, as far south as
San Diego, feeding on the mistletoe berries. He found their nests at Fort
Vancouver, and has no doubt that they also breed in various parts of California.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Kennicott states, among other memoranda of his route, that,
May 31, on an island in Winnipeg River, he saw a large flock of these
birds, numbering fifty or more.</p>

<p>With some irregularity as to their appearance, they are found throughout
the year in New England, their presence being usually regulated by their
food. They are, by preference, eaters of berries and other vegetable food,
except in spring and early summer, when they eat insects almost exclusively,
feeding upon the larvæ of the spanworm and the canker-worm, and small
caterpillars, and supplying these to their young. They also feed their nestlings
with various kinds of berries and small fruits, both cultivated and wild.
They do not nest until late in June or early in July, and with so much
<!--466.png--><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 403]</span>
irregularity that I have found them sitting on their unhatched eggs as late
as the 12th of October. They are a greedy bird, feeding voraciously where
they have an opportunity. They are very much attached to each other and
to their offspring. Once, when one had been taken in a net spread over
strawberries, its mate refused to leave it, suffered itself to be taken by the
hand, in its anxiety to free its mate, and when set at liberty would not leave
until its mate had also been released and permitted to go with it. In the
summer of 1870 a nestling, hardly half fledged, fell from its nest, and was
found injured by its fall, taken into the house, and fed. Whenever exposed
in its cage its parents came about it, and supplied it with cherries and other
fruit, unmindful of the near presence of the family. The young bird lived,
and became perfectly tame, feeding from the hand, and preferring to be fed
rather than feed itself. Besides its low lisping call, this bird had a regular
faint attempt at a song of several low notes, uttered in so low a tone that it
would be almost inaudible at even a short distance. It became perfectly
contented in confinement, and appeared fond of such members of the family
as noticed it.</p>

<p>The noticeable feature of the Cedar-Bird, its crest, it has the power to
erect or depress at will. In confinement it generally keeps this depressed,
only erecting it when excited from any cause, such as alarm, or desire to
receive food.</p>

<p>Wilson states that in Pennsylvania they collect in August in large flocks
and retire to the mountains, feeding on the fruit of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vaccinium uliginosum</i>,
which grows there in great abundance. Later in the season they
descend to the lowlands to feed on the berries of the sour-gum and the red-cedar.
In confinement they are very fond of apples, bread soaked in milk,
and almost any kind of soft food. They are also very fond of flies, and are
expert flycatchers, snapping at all that venture within the cage.</p>

<p>In their migrations their flight is graceful, easy, and continued, and is performed
at a considerable height.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate for the horticulturist that this bird has done so much to
merit his prejudices and reprobation, and that he does not appreciate to the
full the immense services it renders to him each spring in the destruction
of injurious insects. A flock of these birds will, in a short space of time,
devour an immense number of the larvæ of the destructive canker-worms
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phalænæ</i>) that infest the apples and elms of Massachusetts, and, if permitted,
would soon greatly reduce their numbers. But these prejudices cannot
be softened by their good deeds, and the Cherry-Bird is still hunted and
destroyed.</p>

<p>Their nests are usually constructed late in June or early in July, and are
placed in various positions, sometimes in a low bush or tree not more than
three or four feet from the ground, and rarely more than twenty. Their
nests are large and bulky, but strongly made of various materials. Generally
they build a strong external framework, six or seven inches in diameter,
<!--467.png--><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 404]</span>
composed of the ends of twigs, coarse stems of vegetables, and grasses.
Within this they build a compact, well-made fabric of grasses, grapevine
bark, and other finer substances, lining the whole with leaves and fine root-fibres.
The cavity is large and deep for the bird. The parents are fourteen
days in incubating before the young are hatched out, and all this while are
remarkably silent, hardly uttering a sound, even their faintest lisping note,
when the nest is meddled with, though they evince great anxiety by their
fearless indifference to their own danger.</p>

<p>The eggs, usually five, sometimes six, in number, have a marked resemblance
to those of the Waxwing, but are smaller. Their ground-color varies
from a light slate-color to a deep shade of stone-color, tinged with olive.
These are marked with blotches of a dark purplish-brown, almost black,
lighter shades of a dark purple, and penumbræ of faint purple, sometimes
by themselves or surrounding and continuing the darker spots. They vary
in length from .80 to .88 of an inch, and average about .85. In breadth they
are from .60 to .70 of an inch, and in shape they differ also from an oblong-oval
to one of a quite rounded form.</p>

<p>Nests of these birds from the Arctic regions are more elaborately built and
more warmly lined, being often largely made up of the fine
dark-colored
lichens that cover the forest trees of those regions.</p>

<p>This species was first detected
within the United States by Colonel McCall, who obtained it in California
in 1852. Its habits, as he observed them, partook of those of the true Flycatcher.
They are said to be remarkable for their slender, active form, in
which their long and ample tail, and the elongated feathers of their head,
capable of being erected into a crest, are conspicuous features. Colonel
McCall first met with them in a clump of trees on the borders of a mountain
brook, between Valliecita and El Chino. A number of them were together
actively engaged in the pursuit of insects. They were light and
graceful on the wing, though less swift and
decided in their motions than the true Flycatchers.
In these evolutions the bright white
spot on the wing, visible only when the wing
is spread, was quite conspicuous, and in fine
contrast with the glossy black of the general
plumage. In his journey Colonel McCall afterwards
met this bird several times, either in
small companies or singly. They were always
either on mountain sides, or in the timbered
borders of mountain streams.</p>

<p>Dr. Henry met with this species near the
Little Lagoon, on the Colorado Desert. It was
perched on a mezquite-tree, jerking its tail
almost incessantly, as do other kinds of Flycatchers,
and, from time to time, dashing in irregular curves high into the
air in pursuit of insects. It became quite abundant as he approached the
Colorado, occurring in companies of twenty and thirty. At Fort Yuma he
also met with them in considerable numbers late in November, as they were
<!--470.png--><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 407]</span>
migrating southward. Dr. Henry describes its note as a low, plaintive
whistle. He ascertained that it breeds in California by finding specimens
of young birds. He likewise met with this species near Fort Webster, in
New Mexico; and Dr. Kennerly also noticed it, in February and March,
between Big Sandy Creek and the Colorado River.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser obtained two specimens of this species at Eagle Pass. One
of these had its stomach filled with the berries of a species of mistletoe that
grows abundantly on the mezquite-trees. He noticed that it carries its crest
erect and much recurved, after the manner of the European <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parus cristatus</i>.</p>

<p>Sumichrast states that this species, called <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Reyecito</i>, is well distributed
throughout the Plateau of Mexico, but only ranges in the valley of the Orizaba,
to the height of about 1,500 metres, rarely coming as far as that. It
is also common at Tehauntepec and other places.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found them quite numerous, in winter, near the Colorado. He
also found them common, in December, about the Mohave River, and in summer,
from Los Angeles to San Diego. They were found to prefer the trees
in which the mistletoe grows, on the berries of which they largely feed,
though they occasionally pursue insects in a zigzag course similar to that
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sayornis nigricans</i>.</p>

<p>They almost constantly utter a loud cry of alarm, and when pursued are
very wild. When wounded, they conceal themselves so closely in the thick
tufts of the mistletoe as to be found with difficulty. Many left the Colorado
Valley in April, but a few remained. Their notes Dr. Cooper describes as
similar to those of the Crested Flycatchers, but sweeter.</p>

<p>It was found by Feilner, at Fort Crook, in April, 1860, but has not been
met with near the coast so far to the north.</p>

<p>A nest of this bird, obtained by Dr. Cooper, on the 27th of April, was built
on a horizontal branch of the mezquite (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Algarobia</i>), twelve feet from the
ground. It was found near Fort Mohave, on the Colorado River. The nest
is a very flat structure, four inches in diameter, and less than two in height.
The cavity is less than an inch in depth. The nest is made almost entirely
of hempen or flax-like fibres of plants, interwoven with fine grasses, stems
of plants, and stalks of a larger size. It is lined with a soft downy substance
of a vegetable character.</p>

<p>The eggs, two in number, are of an oblong-oval shape, nearly equal at
either end, and with a ground-color of a light slate, tinged with a yellowish-green.
They are marked and blotched equally over the entire egg, with spots
and blotches of various lines, from a light, faint, obscure purple to deeper tints
of purplish-brown, even to black. It is a very marked egg, and unique in
its appearance. They measure .90 by .60 of an inch.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found this species a summer resident in Arizona, somewhat
rare about Fort Whipple, but found very abundantly a little farther south,
and a permanent resident in the southern portions of that Territory. It
inhabits rather open country in preference to densely wooded regions. He
<!--471.png--><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 408]</span>
describes it as a shy, wild, and restless bird, with a superb song, powerful
and finely modulated. Dr. Coues appears to think that this species has but
little affinity with the forms with which it is usually grouped.</p>

<p class="p2 center smaller"><span class="sc">Section</span> <b class="birdname ls">MYIADESTEÆ</b>.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Characteristics"><span class="sc">Char.</span></abbr>
Tarsus slender, longer than middle toe and claw; undivided as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdidæ</i>.
Toes deeply cleft. Wings more pointed; second quill much longer than secondaries.
Lateral tail-feathers cuneate, or narrowing from base towards tip; generally whitish
at end of inner web. Quills with their extreme bases, especially of inner webs, buffy yellow,
showing a light patch inside. Head not crested, though the feathers sometimes full.
In the young all the feathers with light rounded spots. Pre-eminent as melodious singers.</p>

<p>But a single genus of this group belongs to the United States, although
two others (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cichlopsis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Platycichla?</i>) occur in South America. As already
stated, the affinities of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myiadesteæ</i> are much closest to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdidæ</i>, and this
would seem the proper family for it.</p>

and the habits of the species unknown. Through the government explorations,
however, we have been made more familiar with its habits and peculiarities.</p>

<p>Dr. Newberry, in his report on the Zoölogy of Lieutenant Williamson’s
explorations, mentions finding this bird very abundant in the Des Chutes
Basin. It did not frequent either dense forests or prairies destitute of trees,
but seemed to select surfaces covered with a scattered growth of pine and
cedar. His party first met with it at the base of Mount Jefferson, in the
cañon of Mpto-ly-as River. In picking his way with infinite difficulty down
this gorge, his attention was drawn by its new and attractive song. There
were several of them in the pines and cedars
growing on the face of the cliff. He describes its
song as clear, full, and melodious, like that of a
true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mimus</i>. The next day, as he followed down
the river, in the bottom of the cañon the deep
gorge was filled with a chorus of sweet sounds
from thousands of these birds. He describes
them as having a habit of sitting on the branch
of a tree projecting over a stream, or hanging
from some projecting crag, and at times flying
out in narrow circles, after insects, precisely in
the manner of Flycatchers.</p>

<p>Afterwards, in another cañon, the terraced
banks of which were sparsely set with low trees
of the Western cedar, he again found these birds
quite numerous, and had every opportunity both of hearing and of seeing
them, watching them for hours while feeding and singing. They began their
songs with the first dawn of day, and at sunrise the valley was perfectly
vocal with their music. He describes their song as not greatly varied, but
speaks of all their notes as particularly clear and sweet, and with strains of
pure gushing melody that were both spontaneous and inspiring. At that
time, September 30, they were feeding on the berries of the cedar. They
were very shy, and could only be obtained by stratagem.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly, in his Report on the birds observed in the explorations
under the charge of Lieutenant Whipple, speaks of meeting with these birds
in the Rocky Mountains, in the vicinity of the Pueblo of Zuñi, in New
Mexico. Thence, westward, he occasionally met with it, and usually in the
cedar thickets.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley mentions, in his Report on the Zoölogy of Washington Territory,
obtaining a specimen of this species at Fort Steilacoom, April 28, 1856.
It was very wild and difficult of approach. It was the only specimen obtained,
and he considered it accidental west of the Cascade Mountains. Dr.
Cooper, in the same Report, speaks of obtaining a specimen near Fort Laramie
in October, where it seemed to be not uncommon.</p>

<p><!--474.png--><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 411]</span>
Dr. Cooper, in his Birds of California, dwells with much emphasis upon
the delightful melody of this species. Having always found them silent, and
with habits like the Flycatchers’, he was quite unprepared to hear them singing
in the Sierra Nevada, and, if he had not obtained the bird, would not
have believed that one of this family was capable of singing with such
power. Their song, he says, can be compared with nothing uttered by any
other bird he has ever heard in the United States; for, he adds, it excels that
of the Mocking-Bird in sweetness, besides being entirely original.</p>

<p>He met with only a few of this species among some junipers on the western
slope near the summit, in September, 1863. He has always met with
them nearly singly. Dr. Henry found them at Fort Webster, New Mexico,
in large numbers, both in fall and in winter. Their home, Dr. Cooper thinks,
seems to be in the vicinity of the great deserts of the central regions, or the
cedar-covered mountains that intersect them.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse obtained several specimens on the Zuñi Mountains in
New Mexico, and from there westward found it exceedingly abundant. Its
food seemed to be exclusively berries, and chiefly those of the cedar.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues also found these birds rare summer residents in Arizona, and
confirms its possession of rare local powers, producing a rich, sweet, and
finely modulated song.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Ridgway, in accompanying Mr. King’s party of explorations,
writes that he found this curious bird only occasionally, most frequently
among the pines of the Sierra Nevada, and only once or twice among the
mountains east of that range. In July, 1867, he found a nest of this bird.
It was in a deep ravine on the western slope of the Sierras, at an altitude of
five thousand feet. It was placed in a cavity of the rocks forming the perpendicular
upper bank of a sluice constructed for mining purposes, through
which ran the waters of a considerable mountain stream. The nest was about
a foot above the water, and was as bulky as that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Harporhynchus rufus</i>,
and similarly constructed, being composed almost entirely of sticks. It contained
four young. When he approached, the female was much excited, flying
before, or running on the ground in the manner of a true Thrush. Mr.
Ridgway makes no mention of its song.</p>

<p>Mr. Lord met with these birds only once, and then at Colville, towards the
end of November. All the leaves had fallen, the ground was deeply covered
with snow, and the cold was intense. His attention was first attracted by
hearing a low sweet song, not unlike that of the Song Thrush of Europe,
which at that season was a most unusual sound. On looking around he
saw about twenty of these birds perched on the top sprays of some white
thorn-bushes. In their mode of darting off and returning again they reminded
him of a Shrike. He shot six, and could detect no material
difference in plumage between males and females. In the stomachs of
those he opened were the remains of small coleopterous insects and a few
haws.</p>

<p>The description of this and the succeeding species will be found on <a href="#Page_413">page
413</a>. In winter, the colors, especially of the immature birds, are quite
different from those described. The plumage of the adult, in winter, differs
from that of spring as follows: the lores and nasal tufts are whitish, instead
of pure, sharply defined black, with,
however, some of the hair-like fibres
blackish. The ash above is a little
less clear, the white beneath less pure;
the under mandible whitish at the base.
An immature bird, in winter, has the ash
above overlaid by a wash of reddish-brown,
producing a prevailing uniform
light-brown tint; the black on side of
head is reduced to an obsolete patch on
the ear-coverts. The dull white beneath
is everywhere&mdash;sometimes even on the
lower tail-coverts&mdash;covered with numerous
bars of dusky, more sharply
defined, and darker than in the adult.</p>

<p>Eastern specimens appear to have as much white on the rump as Western
ones.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> In the breeding-season this species of Shrike is found in all
North America north of the United States, and is said to breed also within
our territory, in mountainous districts. Such, at least, is the statement of
Mr. Audubon, and Wilson leaves us to infer the same thing by giving a
minute description of its nest and eggs. But Audubon may have confounded
this species with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excubitoroides</i>, and Wilson, apparently believing
our species and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excubitor</i> of Europe to be identical, may have had the
<!--481.png--><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 416]</span>
nest and eggs of the European bird in view in his description. We know
of a single recent instance in which this bird has bred within the limits
of the United States, though it may breed in Northern and Eastern Maine.
Mr. Boardman spoke of it as common only in winter, near Calais, but
he has since met with its nest in New Brunswick, within twelve miles
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen. It was supposed by his informant to be the nest of the
Canada Jay, but proved, on shooting the parent, to be that of the Northern
Shrike. When found, it contained four eggs, but these had hatched
out before it was secured. The nest was found on the last of April, and
was built in a low spruce-tree. Mr. Boardman has since seen these birds in
his neighborhood during the summer. Professor Verrill thinks it is only
common in the autumn and winter in Western Maine. In Western Massachusetts,
Mr. Allen cites it as not very common, but a regular winter visitant,
from the last of October to the middle of April.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway met with it frequently in the neighborhood of Carson City
during the winter, among the willows bordering the streams that flow from
the mountains. Dr. Coues also found it as far south as Arizona, though
Mr. Dresser did not meet with any in Texas, nor did Dr. Woodhouse notice
any in his expedition to the Zuñi. Captain Feilner found this species common,
in the colder months, in the northeastern portions of California, and
Dr. Cooper gives it as abundant at the Columbia River in October.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon further states that in severe winters he has met with it as
far south as Natchez on the Mississippi. It is also not uncommon in Kentucky
during the same season, but he never met with it near the seaboard.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennicott’s memoranda in reference to this species are to the effect
that he observed one individual at Fort Simpson, September 23, and again
October 22, but on no other occasion. Both of these specimens, when first
observed, were singing. Their notes, he states, were low and irregular, but
were varied and quite musical. Captain Blakiston found these birds winter
residents on the Saskatchewan.</p>

<p>In the fall and winter of 1871, a pair of these birds was attracted to the
Common, in Boston, by the large number of half-domesticated European
Sparrows. For a while they made daily inroads upon these favorites, killing
one or more for several days in succession. They appeared to keep themselves
secreted most of the time, showing themselves each day early in the
forenoon, and pouncing upon their victims, unaware of their near presence, in
the manner of a Hawk, aiming always at the heads, which were torn off and
devoured; generally the headless remains were left uneaten. In one instance
where a Sparrow had been struck on the back, an ugly wound was
made, the bird escaped alive, and was soon after seen, in the middle of Tremont
Street, apparently not seriously injured. These Shrikes were so bold
and destructive that pains had to be taken to watch for and shoot them.
Three were killed, on different days, and each with a dead Sparrow in its
claws, upon which it was feasting when shot.</p>

<p><!--482.png--><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 417]</span>
Both Mr. Audubon and Mr. Nuttall refer to this Shrike’s imitating the
cries of other birds, apparently to decoy them within its reach. The former
has heard it utter cries like those of the Sparrow screaming in the claws of
a Hawk, to induce them to come out of their coverts and rescue their suffering
fellows, and has seen them dart suddenly into a thicket in pursuit of one,
from which would soon issue the real cries of the bird it had seized. Nuttall
states that in some parts of New England this Shrike is called a Mocking-Bird,
on account of its imitations of the notes of smaller birds. Its more
usual note resembles the discordant creaking of a signboard hinge. He also
states that it has been known to mimic the quacking of ducks, so that
these would answer to it as to a decoy. He heard one of these birds, as
late as November 10, uttering a low and soft warble, resembling that of the
Song Sparrow, immediately after changing it to the notes of the Catbird.</p>

<p>When in pursuit of small birds, it will dart down with closed wings, in
the manner of a Hawk, and seldom fails to obtain the object of its pursuit,
following it with rapidity and pertinacity through the thickets in which it
seeks shelter. When it seizes its prey, it alights on its back, and tears open
its head.</p>

<p>Its bold audacity and perseverance are quite remarkable, and are often displayed,
in the fall, in the manner in which it will enter an apartment
through an open window and attack a Canary, even in the presence of members
of the family. It rarely fails, if it gains access to the cage, to destroy its
inmate before the latter can be rescued by the intervention of those present,
and only by great promptness in sheltering the cage. In one instance the
writer was sitting at a closed window reading, with a Canary hanging above
him. Suddenly there was a severe blow struck at the pane of glass near
the cage, and the frightened Canary uttered cries of alarm and fell to the
bottom of its cage. The cause was soon explained. A Shrike had dashed
upon the bird, unconscious of the intervening glass, and was stretched upon
the snow under the window, stunned by the blow. He revived when taken
up, and lived several days, was sullen, but tame, and utterly devoid of fear.
He refused raw meat, but eagerly tore in pieces and devoured small birds
when given to him. His tameness and indifference to our presence may have
been occasioned by stupor arising from his injury. In another case a Shrike
made a similar attack, but escaped unharmed, and though he remained about
the house several days, was too wary to allow himself to be decoyed within
gunshot.</p>

<p>A nest of the Northern Shrike, containing six eggs, was obtained by
R. R. McFarlane, at Anderson River Fort, June 11, 1863. This is in many
respects in striking contrast with the nests of its kindred species of the
Southern States, far exceeding them in its relative size, in elaborate finish
and warmth. It is altogether a remarkable example of what are known as
felted nests, where various materials are most elaborately worked together
into a homogeneous and symmetrical whole. It is seven inches in diameter
<!--483.png--><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 418]</span>
and three and a half in height. The cavity is proportionately large and
deep, having a diameter of four and a half inches, and a depth of two.
Except the base, which is composed of a few twigs and stalks of coarser
plants, the nest is made entirely of warm and soft materials, most elaborately
interworked together. These materials are feathers from various birds, fine
down of the Eider and other ducks, fine mosses and lichens, slender stems,
grasses, etc., and are skilfully and artistically wrought into a beautiful and
symmetrical nest, strengthened by the interposition of a few slender twigs
and stems without affecting the general felt-like character of the whole. The
egg measures 1.10 inches by .80, and is of a light greenish ground, marbled
and streaked with blotches of obscure-purple, clay-color, and rufous-brown.</p>

<p>Sir John Richardson found this a by no means uncommon bird in the
woody districts, at least as far as the sixteenth parallel. On account
of its resemblance to the Canada Jay, the Indians called it the “White
Whiskey-John.” It remains all winter in the fur regions, but is much more
numerous in summer. He states that the nest is built in the fork of a tree,
of dry grass and lichens neatly intertwined, and lined with feathers.</p>

<p>The young bird is quite different from the adult, differing as does that of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excubitoroides</i>, but the colors are all darker than in the corresponding age of
that species.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species, if we regard it as distinct from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excubitoroides</i>,
has apparently a very restricted distribution, being confined to the South
Atlantic and Gulf States. I am not aware that it has been found farther
north than North Carolina. It is not common, according to Audubon,
either in Louisiana or Mississippi, and probably only occurs there in the
winter. I have had its eggs from South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.
Dresser speaks of this Shrike as common in Texas in summer, and Dr.
Woodhouse states that he found it very abundant in Texas and the Indian
Territory. These observations may probably apply to the kindred race, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excubitoroides</i>,
and not to this form.</p>

<p>It is said to be exclusively a bird of the lowlands, and never to be met
with in the mountainous parts, even of its restricted habitat.</p>

<p><!--484.png--><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 419]</span>
Dr. Coues found this species very common in the neighborhood of Columbia,
<abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>, frequenting the wooded streets and waste fields of that city. On
one occasion he observed a Loggerhead busily foraging for insects in the
grounds of the Capitol. From the top of a tall bush it would occasionally
sally out, capture a large grasshopper, and carry it to a tree near by, full of
sharp twigs. It would then proceed to impale the insect on one of these
points, remain awhile watching the result of its performance, and then resume
its post on the bush, watching for more grasshoppers, some of which,
one by one, it caught and impaled in like manner, others it ate on the spot.</p>

<p>This curious habit of impaling insects, more or less common to the entire
family of Shrikes, seems to admit of no satisfactory explanation. In this
case the bird thus secured them when apparently hungry, eating some and
impaling others. Yet, so far as I know, it never makes any use of those it
thus impales.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon states that in South Carolina it is quite common along the
fences and hedges about the rice plantations at all seasons, and that it renders
good service to the planters in the destruction of field-mice, as well as
of many of the larger insects. He speaks of its song as consisting only of
shrill, clear, creaking, prolonged notes, resembling the grating of a rusty
hinge. His account differs, in many respects, from the more minute and
exact descriptions of <abbr title="Review">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Bachman. In pursuing its prey, he states
that it invariably strikes it with its bill before seizing it with its claws.</p>

<p>In reference to its song, Dr. Bachman states that it has other notes besides
the grating sound mentioned by Audubon. During the breeding-season, and
nearly all the summer, the male bird posts itself at the top of some tree
and makes an effort at a song, which he compares to the first attempts of a
young Brown Thrush. This is a labored effort, and at times the notes are
not unpleasing, but very irregular.</p>

<p>Dr. Bachman also claims that the male evinces marked evidences of attachment
to his mate, carrying to her, every now and then, a grasshopper or a
cricket, and driving away hawk or crow as they approach the nest.</p>

<p>He also states that he has usually found the nest on the outer limbs of
trees, often from fifteen to thirty feet from the ground, and only once on a
bush so low as ten feet from the ground. He has occasionally seen these
birds feeding on mice, and also on birds that had been apparently wounded
by the sportsman. It will sometimes catch young birds and devour them,
but its food consists chiefly of grasshoppers, crickets, coleopterous and other
insects, including butterflies and moths, which it will pursue and capture
on the wing. Dr. Bachman has observed its habit of pinning insects on
thorns. In one instance he saw it occupy itself for hours in sticking up, in
this way, small fishes thrown on the shore, but he has never known them to
devour anything thus impaled.</p>

<p>This Shrike is partially migratory in South Carolina, as a few may be
found all winter, but only one tenth of those seen in summer. It is also
<!--485.png--><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 420]</span>
very fond of the little changeable green lizard, which it pursues with great
skill and activity, but not always with success.</p>

<p>It is said also to breed twice in a season. Dr. Bachman describes their
eggs as white, and Mr. Audubon speaks of them as greenish-white. Neither
make any reference to their spots.</p>

<p>All the nests that I have ever seen of this species, in the simplicity of
their structure and in their lack of elaboration, are in remarkable contrast
with the nests of both the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">borealis</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excubitoroides</i>. They are flat,
shallow structures, with a height of about two inches and a diameter of five.
They are made externally of long soft strips of the inner bark of the basswood,
strengthened on the sides with a few dry twigs, stems, and roots.
Within, it is lined with fine grasses and stems of herbaceous plants.</p>

<p>The eggs, often six in number, are in length from 1.02 to 1.08 inches, and
from .72 to .78 of an inch in breadth; their ground-color is a yellowish or
clayey-white, blotched and marbled with dashes, more or less confluent, of
obscure purple, light brown, and a purplish-gray. The spots are usually
larger and more scattered than in the eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. borealis</i>, and the ground-color
is a yellowish and not a bluish white, as in the eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. excubitoroides</i>.</p>

class="sc">Sykes</span>, of Siberia.)</p>

<p class="small"><span class="sc">Hab.</span> California?</p>

<p>The description already given is taken from a specimen in the collection of
the Philadelphia Academy, labelled as having been collected in California by
Dr. Gambel, and is very decidedly different from any of the recognized North
American species. Of nearly the size of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. excubitoroides</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludovicianus</i>,
it has a bill even more powerful than that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. borealis</i>. In its unwaved
under parts and uniform color of the entire upper surface, except scapulars,
it differs from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">borealis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excubitoroides</i>, and resembles <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludovicianus</i>. In the
extension of white over the inner webs of the secondaries, it closely resembles
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. excubitor</i>. The great restriction of white at the base of the tail&mdash;the
four central feathers being entirely black, and the bases of the others
grayish-ashy&mdash;is quite peculiar to the species.</p>

<p>The specimen in the Philadelphia Academy we originally referred to the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. elegans</i> of Swainson, alleged to have come from the fur countries, as although
some appreciable differences presented themselves, especially in the
<!--486.png--><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 421]</span>
coloration of the tail, these were considered as resulting from an imperfect
description. Messrs. Sharpe and Dresser, however, as quoted above, show
that Swainson’s type really belongs to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. lahtora</i>, an Old World species.
We therefore find it expedient to give a new name to the variety, having no
reason to discredit the alleged locality of the specimen.</p>

<p>The precise boundaries between this species and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. ludovicianus</i> are difficult
of definition, as the transition is almost insensible.</p>

<p>The young bird is pale fulvous-ash above, everywhere with transverse
crescentic bars of dusky. Two bands of mottled pale fulvous across wings,
on tips of middle and greater coverts. Tail tipped with ochraceous, the
white feathers tinged with the same. Breast and sides with obsolete bars of
dusky. Black band on side of head rather obsolete.</p>

<p>In its extreme stage of coloration it differs from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludovicianus</i> in paler and
purer color; the ash of back lighter; the under parts brilliant white, not
decidedly plumbeous on the sides as in the other, and without so great a
tendency to the usual obsolete waved lines (noticed distinctly only in winter
or immature birds); the axillars bluish-white, not plumbeous. The white
of wings and tail is more extended; the hoary of forehead and whitish of
scapulars more distinct. The bristles at base of bill somewhat involving the
feathers are black, forming a narrow frontal line, not seen in the other. The
most striking difference is in the rump and upper tail-coverts, which are
always appreciably and abruptly lighter than the back, sometimes white or
only faintly glossed with plumbeous; while in typical specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludovicianus</i>
these feathers are scarcely lighter at all, and generally more or less
varied with blackish spots at the end. The legs and tail are apparently longer,
the latter less graduated. These differences are, however, most appreciable in
specimens from the Middle and Western Provinces. Those from the Western
States, east of the Missouri River, as far north as Wisconsin, are more intermediate
between the two, although still nearest to the Rocky Mountain bird
<!--487.png--><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 422]</span>
as described; the back darker, the rump and axillars more plumbeous, the
sides more bluish. There is little doubt that the examination of series from
the States along the Mississippi will show a still closer resemblance to typical
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. ludovicianus</i>, and that the gradation between the two extremes will be
found to be continuous and unbroken. It therefore seems reasonable to consider
them all as one species, varying with longitude and region according
to the usual law,&mdash;the more western the lighter, with longer tail. The only
alternative is to suppose that two species, originally distinct, have hybridized
along the line of junction of their respective provinces, as is certainly sometimes
the case. The approximation in many respects of coloration of the
Shrikes of the Pacific coast to those of the South Atlantic States is not without
its importance in the discussion of the subject. However it may be, it
is necessary to retain the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excubitoroides</i>,
as representing, whether as
species or variety, a peculiar regional
form, which must be kept distinctly in
mind. The comparatively greater size
of the bill in the Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas specimens
is seen in other species from this
locality (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 26,438 of adjacent figure).</p>

<p>The intensity of the black front in
this species varies considerably, being
sometimes very distinct, and again entirely wanting. This may probably
be a character of the breeding-season, the dulness of black anterior to the eye
and the lighter color of the bill having a close relationship here, as in other
species, to maturity, sex, and season.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This variety was first described from specimens obtained in the
territory of the Hudson’s Bay <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> Richardson states that it was not found
farther north than the fifty-fourth degree, and there only in the warm and
sandy plain of the Saskatchewan. Its manners, he says, are precisely similar
to those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">borealis</i>, feeding chiefly on the grasshoppers, which were very
numerous on the plains. Mr. Drummond found its nest in the beginning of
June, in a bush of willows. It was built of the twigs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Artemisia</i> and
dry grass, and lined with feathers. The eggs were six in number, of a
pale yellowish-gray color, with many irregular and confluent spots of oil-green,
mixed with a few of smoke-gray.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway met with it, in his Western explorations, in all localities, but
most frequently among the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Artemisia</i> and in the meadow-tracts of the river
valleys. It is also seen on all parts of the mountains, among the cedar
groves, localities in which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludovicianus</i> is said never to be found.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper describes this bird as abundant in all the plains-region of California,
but not as far as the Columbia River. South of latitude 38<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, they reside
all the year. They were abundant about Fort Mohave all winter, and nested
as early as the 19th of March in a thorn-bush. They had young early in
<!--488.png--><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 423]</span>
April. At San Diego they nested later, about April 20. He speaks of their
singing as an attempt at a song, the notes being harsh, like those of a Jay,
but not imitative. They catch birds, but do so very rarely, depending upon
grasshoppers and other insects.</p>

<p>The nests of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excubitoroides</i>, so far as I have had any opportunity to examine
them, always exhibit a very marked contrast, in the elaborateness of
their structure, to any of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludovicianus</i> that have fallen under my notice.
They resemble those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">borealis</i> in their size and the felted nature of their
walls, but are more coarsely and rudely put together. They have an external
diameter of about eight inches, and a height of four. The cavity is also
large and deep. These nests are always constructed with much artistic skill
and pains. The base is usually a closely impacted mass of fine grasses, lichens,
mosses, and leaves, intermingled with stout dry twigs. Upon this is wrought
a strong fabric of fine wood-mosses, flaxen fibres of plants, leaves, grasses, fur
of quadrupeds, and other substances. Intertwined with these are a sufficient
number of slender twigs and stems of plants to give to the whole a remarkable
strength and firmness. This is often still further strengthened by an
external protection woven of stouter twigs and small ends of branches,
stems, etc. The whole is then thoroughly and warmly lined with a soft
matting of the fur of several kinds of small animals, vegetable down, and a
few feathers.</p>

<p>The eggs, five or six in number, measure 1.00 by .73 of an inch, and strongly
resemble those of both the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">borealis</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludovicianus</i>. Their ground-color
is pale greenish-white, over which are marks and blotches, more or less confluent,
of lilac, purplish-brown, and light umber.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway, who is familiar with this bird in Southern Illinois, informs
me that in that section it is a resident species, being abundant during the
summer and by no means rare in the winter. It is there, strangely enough,
often called the Mocking-Bird, its similar appearance and fondness for the
same locality leading some persons to confound these very different birds.
In districts where the true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mimus</i> is not common, young birds of this species
are frequently taken from their nests and innocently sold to unsuspecting
admirers of that highly appreciated songster.</p>

<p>This bird inhabits, almost exclusively, open situations, being particularly
fond of waste fields where young honey-locusts (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gleditschia triacanthos</i>) have
grown up. Among their thorny branches its nests are almost utterly inaccessible,
if beyond the reach of poles. In such localities this bird may often
be seen perched in an upright position upon some thorn-bush, or a fence-stake,
quietly watching for its prey, remaining nearly an hour at a time
motionless except for an occasional movement of the head.</p>

<p>The flight of this bird, Mr. Ridgway adds, is quite peculiar, utterly unlike
that of any other bird except the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oreoscoptes montanus</i>, which it only slightly
resembles. In leaving its perch it sinks nearly to the ground, describing a
curve as it descends, and, passing but a few feet above the surface, ascends in
<!--489.png--><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 424]</span>
the same manner to the object upon which it is next to light. The flight is
performed in an undulating manner, the bird sustaining itself a short time
by a rapid fluttering of the wings, and sinking as this motion is suspended.
As it flies, the white patch on the wing, with the general appearance of its
gray and white plumage, increases its resemblance to the Mocking-Bird.</p>

<p>Though very partial to thorn-trees (honey-locust), other trees having a
thick foliage&mdash;as those canopied by a tangled mass of wild
grapevines&mdash;are
frequently occupied as nesting-places; while a pair frequently make
their home in an apple-orchard, selecting the old untrimmed trees. The
situation of the nest varies according to the character of the tree; if in a
thorn-bush, it is placed next the trunk, encased within protecting bunches of
thorns; but if in an apple-tree, it is situated, generally, near the extremity of
a horizontal branch. The number of eggs is generally six, but Mr. Ridgway
has several times found seven in one nest. No bird is more intrepid in the
defence of its nest than the present one; at such times it loses, apparently,
all fear, and becomes almost frenzied with anger, alighting so near that one
might grasp it, were he quick enough, and with open mouth and spread
wings and tail threatening the intruder, its attacks accompanied by a peculiar
crackling noise, interrupted by a harsh, grating <i class="birdcall">qua</i>, <i class="birdcall">qua</i>, <i class="birdcall">qua</i>, slowly
repeated, but emphatically uttered.</p>

<p>The habit peculiar to the Shrikes of impaling their victims Mr. Ridgway
has observed frequently in this species; for this purpose the long and extremely
sharp thorns of the honey-locust serve it admirably; and “spitted”
upon them he has found shrews, mice, grasshoppers, spiders, and even a
Chimney-Swallow (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chætura pelagica</i>); and, in another instance, but upon
the upright broken-off twig of a dead weed in a field, a large spider. He has
also known this bird to dart at the cage of a Canary-Bird, and frighten the
poor inmate so that it thrust its head between the wires, when it was immediately
torn off by the powerful beak of the Butcher-Bird.</p>

<p>The young of this species becomes a very pleasing and extremely docile
pet. Mr. Ridgway has known one which, though fully grown, with power
of flight uninjured, and in possession of unrestrained freedom, came to its
possessor at his call, and accompanied him through the fields, its attachment
being rewarded by frequent “doses” of grasshoppers, caught for it. It had
been fully feathered before taken from the nest. Unfortunately the vocal
capabilities of this Shrike are not sufficient to allow its becoming a general
favorite as a pet; for, although possessing considerable talent for
mimicry, it imitates only the rudest sounds, while its own notes, consisting
of a grating, sonorous <i class="birdcall">qua</i> and a peculiar creaking sound, each with
several variations, are anything but delightful.</p>

<h2><span class="sc">Family</span> <b class="birdname">CÆREBIDÆ</b>.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Creepers.</span></h2>

<p class="p2">As already stated on <a href="#Page_177">page 177</a>, there is little to distinguish the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cærebidæ</i>
from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvicolidæ</i>, except by the longer and more protracted tongue, and
by the narrower gape in some of the forms. The genera <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Certhiola</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cæreba</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diglossa</i>, etc., have peculiarities by which they are easily recognized; but
when we come to such members as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dacnis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Conirostrum</i>, etc., it becomes
very difficult to separate them from the slender-billed Tanagers, the Wood
Warblers, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Helminthophagas</i>.</p>

<p>Although the family is one widely distributed, in numerous genera, over
Middle and South America, but one, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Certhiola</i>, belongs to North America,
this being represented by a species, or rather a race, abundant in the Bahamas,
and occasionally met with in the Florida Keys. We shall therefore
give only the diagnosis of this family.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="General Characters"><span class="sc">Gen. Char.</span></abbr>
Bill nearly as long as the head; as high as broad at base, elongated, conical,
very acute, and gently decurved from base to tip.
Culmen uniformly convex; gonys concave. No
bristles at base of bill. Tail rounded, rather shorter
than the wings. Tarsi longer than the middle toe.
Iris brown? Nest pensile and arched. Eggs with
yellowish ground dotted thickly with rufous spots.</p>

<p>This genus is one of those especially characterizing
the West Indies, almost every
island as far as known having its peculiar
species, differing, it is true, in very slight
characters, but always constant to the normal type. Cuba alone has so far
furnished no representative of this genus, its place being supplied apparently
by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cæreba cyanea</i>. The specimens from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas I cannot
distinguish from those of Porto Rico, but this is, so far as the series before
me indicates, the only case where one species occurs on two islands. All
the West Indian species, nine or ten in number, agree in having the whole
upper part nearly uniformly dusky or blackish; the head and back being
concolored, while of the three or four South American all but one (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C.
luteola</i>) have the back more olivaceous, the head much darker. Again,
the West Indian species, with a single exception (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. bananivora</i>), have both
webs of lateral tail-feathers broadly and about equally tipped with white;
while in all the South American this white is more restricted on the inner
<!--491.png--><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 426]</span>
web, and on the outer reduced to a narrow border. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. caboti</i> from Cozumel,
near the eastern coast of Yucatan, exhibits the Continental impress in possessing
the character last mentioned.</p>

 <p class="center small"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Certhiola flaveola.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In all the species from the Greater Antilles and the portion of Continental
America west and directly south
of this group, there is a distinct external
white patch at base of quills;
while this disappears in the species of
the Lesser Antilles and eastern South
America, or is only faintly traceable.
Again, in the species of the Lesser
Antilles, with the disappearance of the
white wing-patch, the greater and middle
wing-coverts show a faint edging of
lighter, by which, as well as by the darker back, they are distinguished from
their South American allies.</p>

<p>The shape of the white patch at base of the quills on the outer web furnishes,
in combination with the color of the throat, excellent and permanent
specific characters. This in the Jamaican, Haytien, and Bahaman forms is
elongated, extending gradually and uniformly behind to the outer edge of
the quill, while in those of Porto Rico, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas, Cozumel, and the South
American species, where it exists, the posterior outline is nearly transverse,
and only running out a little along outer web.</p>

<p>As a general rule South American species have shorter tails than the
West Indian.</p>

<p>It is a nice question what are really species in this genus, and what merely
races or varieties; but it would probably be not far from correct to assume
that the various forms described are simply modifications of one primitive
species, produced by geographical distribution and external physical conditions.
In the following diagnosis I shall treat all the varieties as occupying
the same rank, without attempting any discrimination. Although but one
of these belongs to the United States, and that as a straggler from the Bahamas,
I give the table of the whole, to show the interesting relationship between
them.</p>

being blackish. White spot at base of quills very distinct externally; the posterior outline
on each outer web of the primaries not quadrate, but running out obliquely behind
and on the outermost quill reaching the shaft. Edges of quills narrowly margined with
grayish-white; on the secondaries continued round the tips. No distinct bands on the
coverts. Outer tail-feathers broadly tipped with white; this even involving the innermost,
but reduced to a narrow edge. Total length, 4.40; wing, 2.30; tail, 1.80.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Bahamas and Keys of southeast coast of Florida.</p>

<p>A specimen from the Florida Keys (10,367) is rather darker than those
from the Bahamas, the white less extended, and not quite reaching the shafts
in the outer quills.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species, belonging properly to the Bahaman group of the
West Indian Islands, was found at Indian Key, <abbr title="Florida">Fla.</abbr>, January 31, 1858, by
Mr. Würdemann, where it appeared to be not at all rare. Nothing is known
of its habits, but they are doubtless nearly the same as those of the allied
species. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. flaveola</i> is known in Jamaica as the Banana Quit, Honey-Sucker,
and Black and Yellow Creeper. According to the description of
them given by Mr. Gosse, these birds, scarcely larger than the Humming-Birds,
are often seen in company with them, probing the flowers for similar
purposes, but in a very different manner. Instead of hovering like the Humming-Bird
in front of the blossom, for which its short wings would be incompetent,
these birds alight on the tree and proceed in a very business-like
manner. Hopping from twig to twig in an active manner, they carefully
examine each blossom. In doing this they throw their bodies into a variety
of positions, often clinging by the feet with the back downwards, the better
to reach the interior of a blossom with their curved beaks and peculiar tongue.
The objects of these researches are the small insects which are always found
in the interior of flowers. This bird is unsuspecting and familiar, and very
freely resorts to the blossoming shrubs of the gardens and yards. Mr. Gosse
mentions, in evidence of this familiarity, that a large moringa-tree under his
window, as he was writing, and which all through the year was profusely set
with fragrant blossoms, and was a favorite resort of these birds, was being
carefully scrutinized by two active little Creepers. Although within a few
feet of his window, they pursued their examinations, perfectly undisturbed
by his looking on. As they move about they utter a soft sibilant note.</p>

<p>The nests of this little bird are usually built in those low trees and bushes
to which are fastened the nests of the brown wasps, and in close contiguity
to them. Mr. Gosse regards this singular predilection as a remarkable exercise
of instinct, if not of reason, as the evident object of it is the protection
<!--495.png--><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 430]</span>
afforded by the presence of those formidable insects, though upon what terms
of amity this defensive alliance is kept does not appear.</p>

<p>These Creepers incubate during the months of May, June, and July. On
the 4th of May, Mr. Gosse observed one with a bit of “silk-cotton” in her
beak, and found the skeleton of the nest just commenced in a bush of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lantana
camara</i>. It was evidently to be of dome shape, and so far had been constructed
entirely of silk-cotton. The completed nests are made in the form
of a globe, with a small opening below the side. The walls are very thick,
composed of dry grasses intermixed irregularly with the down of asclepias.
One of these nests was fixed between the twigs of a branch of a <i class="plant-name">Bauhinia</i>
projecting over a highway. Another, found towards the end of June, was
built in a bush of <i class="plant-name">Lantana</i>, and of the same structure. It contained two
eggs, greenish-white, thickly but indefinitely dashed with reddish at the
larger end. Mr. Gosse quotes a Mr. Robinson as giving their dimensions at
.44 by .31 of an inch, while his own specimens are much larger than this,
measuring .63 by nearly .50. Two eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. flaveola</i>, from Jamaica, in my
cabinet, measure, .68 by .51 and .68 by .49 of an inch. In one the ground
is a dull white, so generally and thickly covered with minute but confluent
dots of reddish-brown as to impart a pinkish tinge to the whole egg. In the
other the ground is a dull white, sparingly marked with blotches of brown
over about three fourths of its surface, but at the larger end covered with a
crown of larger and confluent blotches of subdued purple and dark umber,
intermingled with a few lines of a darker hue, almost black.</p>

<p>Two eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">G. newtoni</i>, from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix, are of a more rounded-oval shape,
and measure .69 by .45 and .65 by .44 of an inch. They have a dull white
ground, but this is so uniformly and generally covered with confluent reddish-brown
markings as to be nowhere very distinct.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix species is called the Sugar-Bird in that island, from its habit
of entering the curing-houses, through the barred windows, probably attracted
thither by the swarms of flies. It is a very familiar species, haunting gardens,
and often entering houses, and never manifesting any alarm. It keeps
in pairs, and breeds from March to August. Mr. Newton states that it builds
a domed and often pensile nest, with a small porch, or pent-house roof, over
the entrance, generally at the extremity of a leafy bough. The nest is generally
very untidy on the outside, and is composed of coarse grass and cotton,
with feathers on the inside. It deposits its eggs before the completion
of the nest, “rather to the discomfiture of the oölogist, who delays inserting
his finger into the structure while he sees one or both of the birds busy with
a tuft of grass or cotton in their bills, until at last he finds their eggs already
hatched.” Mr. Newton observed one instance in which two broods were
reared in the same nest, with only an interval of ten days between the time
the young left it and the laying of an egg.</p>

<p>The rictus is well provided
with bristles, which bend
downwards, but if brought
forward would reach the
nostrils. These are rounded,
and are closely crowded
by the frontal leathers. The
tarsus is shorter than the
middle toe, scutellate anteriorly, and smooth on the sides behind. The
lateral toes are about equal; the basal joint of the middle toe united for
half its length to the inner toe, and by almost the whole length to the outer.</p>

<p>The following table may serve to distinguish the males of the several species

<p>At least three years seem to be required
for the assumption of the perfect
plumage of the male. In the first
year the young male is like the female,
but has black wings and tail; in the
fall red feathers begin to make their
appearance, and the following spring
the red predominates in patches.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Scarlet Tanager is one
of the most conspicuous and brilliant
of all our summer visitants. Elegant
in its attire, retiring and modest in
manners, sweet in song, and useful in
its destruction of hurtful insects, it
well merits a cordial welcome. This
Tanager is distributed over a wide extent of territory, from Texas to Maine,
and from South Carolina to the northern shores of Lake Huron, in all which
<!--501.png--><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 436]</span>
localities it breeds. A few are found once in a while as far east as Calais, in
the spring, and they are rather occasional than common in Eastern Massachusetts,
but are more plentiful in the western part of the State, becoming
quite common about Springfield, arriving May 15, and remaining about four
months, breeding in high open woods and old orchards. In South Carolina
it is abundant as a migrant, though a few remain and breed in the higher
lands. Mr. Audubon states, also, that a few breed in the higher portions of
Louisiana, and Dr. Heermann found them breeding at El Paso, in New Mexico.
They are far more abundant, however, in the States of Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Virginia, and throughout the Mississippi Valley, arriving early
in May, and leaving in October. Though occasionally found in the more
sparsely settled portions of the country, in orchards and retired gardens, they
are, as a rule, inhabitants of the edges of forests.</p>

<p>Their more common notes are simple and brief, resembling, according to
Wilson, the sounds <i class="birdcall">chip-charr</i>. Mr. Ridgway represents them by <i class="birdcall">chip-a-ra´-ree</i>.
This song it repeats at brief intervals and in a pensive tone, and with
a singular faculty of causing it to seem to come from a greater than the real
distance. Besides this it also has a more varied and musical chant resembling
the mellow notes of the Baltimore Oriole. The female also utters similar
notes when her nest is approached, and in their mating-season, as they
move together through the branches, they both utter a low whispering warble
in a tone of great sweetness and tenderness. As a whole, this bird may
be regarded as a musical performer of very respectable merits.</p>

<p>The food of this species is chiefly gleaned among the upper branches, and
consists of various coleopterous and other insects and their larvæ. Later in
the season they consume various kinds of wild berries.</p>

<p>When their nest is approached, the male bird usually keeps at a cautious
distance, as if fearful of being seen, but his much less gaudy mate hovers
about the intruder in the greatest distress. Wilson relates quite a touching
instance of the devotion of the parent of this species to its young. Having
taken a young bird from the nest, and carried it to his friend, Mr. Bartram,
it was placed in a cage, and suspended near a nest containing young Orioles,
in hopes the parents of the latter would feed it, which they did not do. Its
cries, however, attracted its own parent, who assiduously attended it and supplied
it with food for several days, became more and more solicitous for its
liberation, and constantly uttered cries of entreaty to its offspring to come
out of its prison. At last this was more than Mr. Bartram could endure, and
he mounted to the cage, took out the prisoner, and restored it to its parent,
who accompanied it in its flight to the woods with notes of great exultation.</p>

<p>Early in August the male begins to moult, and in the course of a few days,
dressed in the greenish livery of the female, he is not distinguishable from
her or his young family. In this humble garb they leave us, and do not
resume their summer plumage until just as they are re-entering our southern
borders, when they may be seen in various stages of transformation.</p>

<p><!--502.png--><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 437]</span>
This species is extremely susceptible to cold, and in late and unusually
chilly seasons large numbers often perish in their more northern haunts, as
Massachusetts and Northern New York.</p>

<p>The nests of the Scarlet Tanager are built late in May, or early in June,
on the horizontal branch of a forest tree, usually on the edge of a wood, but
occasionally in an orchard. They are usually very nearly flat, five or six
inches in diameter, and about two in height, with a depression of only about
half an inch. They are of somewhat irregular shape, or not quite symmetrically
circular. Their base is somewhat loosely constructed of coarse stems
of vegetables, strips of bark, and the rootlets of wooded plants. Upon this
is wrought, with more compactness and neatness, a framework, within which
is the lining, of long slender fibrous roots, interspersed with which are slender
stems of plants and a few strips of fine inner bark.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall describes a nest examined by him as composed of rigid stalks
of weeds and slender fir-twigs tied together with narrow strips of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apocynum</i>
and pea-vine runners, and lined with slender wiry stalks of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Helianthemum</i>,
the whole so thinly plaited as readily to admit the light through
the interstices.</p>

<p>The eggs, four or five in number, vary in length from an inch to .90, and
have an average breadth of .65. Their ground-color varies from a well-marked
shade of greenish-blue, to a dull white with hardly the least tinge
of blue. The spots vary in size, are more or less confluent, and are chiefly
of a reddish or rufous brown, intermingled with a few spots of a brownish
and obscure purple.</p>

<span class="sc">Habits.</span> This bird is one of the many instances in which Wilson has been
unfortunate in bestowing upon his new species a geographical name not
appropriate at the present time. We have no evidence that this bird, called
the Louisiana Tanager, is ever found within the modern limits of that State,
although it occurs from the Great Plains to the Pacific, and from Fort Liard,
in the northern Rocky Mountains, to Mexico.</p>

<p>It was first met with by Lewis and Clark’s party, on the Upper Missouri,
a region then known as Louisiana Territory. They were said to inhabit the
extensive plains in what was then called Missouri Territory, building their
nests in low bushes, and even among the grass, and delighting in the various
kinds of berries with which those fertile prairies were said to abound.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall, who met with these birds in his Western excursions, describes
them as continually flitting over those vast downs, occasionally alighting on
the stems of some tall weed, or the bushes bordering the streams. Their
habits are very terrestrial, and from this he infers that they derive their
food from the insects they find near the ground, as well as from the seeds of
the herbage in which they chiefly dwell. He found them a common and
numerous species, remaining in the country west of the Mississippi until the
approach of October. In his first observations of them he states that though
he had seen many of these birds, yet he had no recollection of hearing them
utter any modulated or musical sounds. They appeared to him shy, flitting,
and almost silent.</p>

<p>He first observed these birds in a thick belt of wood near Laramie’s Fork
of the Platte, at a considerable distance east of the Black Hills. He afterwards
found them very abundant, in the spring, in the forests of the Columbia,
below Fort Vancouver. In these latter observations he modified his
views as to their song, and states that he could frequently trace them by
their notes, which are a loud, short, and slow, but pleasing warble, not very
unlike that of the common Robin, delivered from the tops of lofty fir-trees.
Their music continues, at short intervals, during the forenoon, and while
they are busily engaged in searching for larvæ and coleopterous insects, on
the small branches of the trees.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley found this Tanager quite abundant at certain seasons in the
vicinity of Fort Steilacoom. In one year a very limited number were seen;
in another they were very abundant. From frequent opportunities to examine
and to study their habits, he was inclined to discredit the statement of
Nuttall that they descend to low bushes, the reverse being the rule. He
found it very difficult to meet with any sufficiently low down in the trees
for him to kill them with fine shot. Their favorite abode, in the localities
where he observed them, was among the upper branches of the tall <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abies
douglassii</i>. They prefer the edge of the forests, rarely retiring to the depths.
In early summer, at Fort Steilacoom, they could be seen during the middle
of the day, sunning themselves in the firs, or darting from one of those trees
to another, or to some of the neighboring white oaks on the prairie. Later
<!--504.png--><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 439]</span>
in the season they were to be seen flying very actively about in quest of
insect food for their young. On the 10th of July he saw one carrying a worm
in its mouth, showing that its young were then hatched out. During the
breeding-season they are much less shy, the males frequently sitting on some
low limb, rendering the neighborhood joyous with their delightful melody.</p>

<p>Their stomachs were found filled with insects, chiefly coleoptera; among
these were many fragments of the large green <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Buprestis</i>, found on the
Douglass fir-trees.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper adds to this account, that this bird arrives at Puget Sound
about May 15, and becomes a common summer resident in Washington Territory,
especially near the river-banks and among the prairies, on which are
found deciduous trees. He compares its song to that of its black-winged
relative (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. rubra</i>), being of a few notes only, whistled in the manner of
the Robin, and sounding as if the bird were quite distant, when in reality
it is very near. He met with these birds east of the Rocky Mountains and
up to the 49th parallel.</p>

<p>In California the same observer noticed their arrival near San Diego,
in small parties, about the 24th of April. The males come in advance of
their mates, and are more bold and conspicuous, the females being rarely seen.
He saw none of them in the Coast Range toward Santa Cruz, or at Santa
Barbara, in summer. He also found them in September, 1860, in the higher
Rocky Mountains, near the sources of the Columbia, in latitude 47<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. In the
fall the young and the old associate in families, all in the same dull-greenish
plumage, feeding on the berries of the elder, and other shrubs, without the
timidity they manifest in spring.</p>

<p>Mr. J. K. Lord states that he did not once meet with this species west of
the Cascade Mountains. He found them on the Spokan Plains and at Colville,
where they arrive in June. Male birds were the first to be seen. On
their arrival they perch on the tops of the highest pine-trees, and continually
utter a low piercing chirp. They soon after pair, and disappear in the forest.
Where they breed, Mr. Lord was not able to discover, though he sought high
and low for their nests. As he never succeeded in finding them, he conjectured
that they must breed on the tops of the loftiest pine-trees. They all
leave in September, but do not assemble in flocks.</p>

<p>These Tanagers breed at least as far to the south as Arizona, Dr. Coues
having found them a summer resident near Fort Whipple, though rare.
They arrive there in the middle of April, and leave late in September.</p>

<p>Mr. Salvin states that this Tanager was found between the volcanoes of
Agua and Fuego, at an elevation of about five thousand feet. Specimens
were also received from the Vera Paz.</p>

<p>Specimens of this species were taken near Oaxaca, Mexico, by Mr. Boucard,
where they are winter residents.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway writes that he first met with these Tanagers in July, among
the pines of the Sierra Nevada. There its sweet song first attracted his
<!--505.png--><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 440]</span>
attention, it being almost exactly similar to that of its eastern relative
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. rubra</i>). Afterwards he continually met with it in wooded portions,
whether among the willows and cotton wood of the river-valleys, or the
cedars and piñons of the mountains. In May, 1868, among the willows
and buffalo-berry thickets of the Truckee Valley, near Pyramid Lake, it was
very abundant, in company with Grosbeaks and Orioles, feeding upon the
buds of the grease-wood (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Obione</i>), and later in the summer among the cedars
and nut-pines of East Humboldt Mountains, where the peculiar notes of the
young arrested his attention, resembling the complaining notes of the Bluebird,
but louder and more distinct. In September he noticed them feeding,
among the thickets bordering the streams, upon the pulpy fruit of the
thorn-apple (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cratægus</i>) that grew plentifully in the thickets. To the eastward
it was continually met with, in all wooded portions, as far as they
explored.</p>

<p>In manners, it is very similar to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. rubra</i>. The songs of both birds
are very nearly alike, being equally fine, but that of this species is more silvery
in tone, and uttered more falteringly. Its usual note of <i class="birdcall">plit-it</i> is quite
different from the <i class="birdcall">chip-a-ra´-ree</i> of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. rubra</i>.</p>

<p>He met with their nest and eggs at Parley’s Park, Utah, June 9, 1869.
The nest was on the extreme end of a horizontal branch of a pine, in a grove,
flat, and with only a very slight depression, having a diameter of four and a
half inches, with a height of only an inch. It was composed externally of
only a few twigs and dry wiry stems, and lined almost entirely with fine
vegetable rootlets.</p>

<p>The eggs, usually three in number, measure .95 by .66 of an inch. In
form they are a rounded-oval. Their ground-color is a light bluish-green,
sparingly speckled, chiefly at the larger end, with marking of umber, intermingled
with a few dots of lilac.</p>

<p>This species is one of wide distribution; its habitat in the United States
including the “Eastern Province,” north
to Nova Scotia, and west toward the
Rocky Mountains, along the streams
watering the plains, through Texas, into
Eastern Mexico, Central America, and
the northern part of South America, as
well as some of the West India islands.</p>

<p>In the different regions of its habitat
the species undergoes considerable variations
as regards shades of color and
proportions. Specimens from Texas and
Eastern Mexico exhibit a decided tendency
to longer bills and more slender
forms than those of the Eastern United
States; the tails longer, and colors rather purer. In Central America and
New Granada the species acquires the greatest perfection in the intensity
and purity of the red tints, all specimens being in this respect noticeably
different from those of any other region.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_107" id="fnanchor_107"></a><a href="#footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Specimens in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution, from Peru
(39,849 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, 39,849 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, and 39,850 <abbr title="female symbol">♀</abbr>, head-waters Huallaga River), are undistinguishable
from those killed in the eastern United States.</p>

<p>The young male exhibits a variegated plumage, the red appearing in
patches upon the other colors of the female; in its changing plumage, the
red generally predominates on the head, and often individuals may be seen
with none anywhere else. In this condition there appears to be a great resemblance
to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. erythrocephala</i> (see synoptical table), judging from the
description, but which appears to be considerably smaller, and perhaps has
the red of the head more continuous and sharply defined.</p>

<p>The young male in first summer resembles the female, but has the yellow
tints deeper, the lower tail-coverts approaching orange.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Summer Redbird is found chiefly in the Southern States, as
far north as Southern New Jersey and Illinois. Mr. Audubon speaks of their
occurring in Massachusetts, but Mr. Lawrence has never known of their having
been found farther north than the Magnolia Swamps near Atlantic City,
<abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr> One or two recent instances of the capture of these birds in Massachusetts,
as also in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, have occurred, but
these must be regarded as purely accidental.</p>

<p><!--508.png--><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 443]</span>
This species is said by Mr. Salvin to enjoy an almost universal range
throughout Guatemala. It occurred in December at the mouth of the Rio
Dulce, in the pine ridges near Quisigua, and along the whole road from Isabel
to Guatemala, a distance of eighty leagues.</p>

<p>Mr. C. W. Wyatt met with these birds also, in all varieties of plumage,
throughout Colombia, South America, at Herradura, Cocuta Valley, and
Canta. Mr. Boucard obtained them at Plaza Vicente, Mexico. Dr. Woodhouse
observed this species throughout the Indian Territory, Texas, and New
Mexico, where it seemed solitary in its habits, frequenting the thick scrubby
timber. It has been known to breed at various points in Florida, Georgia,
South Carolina, Louisiana, and Texas. To the northward it breeds more or
less abundantly, as far as Washington, D. C., on the east, and Southern Illinois
and Kansas on the west, being much more common in the Mississippi
Valley than in the States on the Atlantic in the same parallel of latitude.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found it quite common about San Antonio, Texas, during the
summer season, arriving there about the middle of April, which is just about
the period at which the three specimens were taken near Boston. It is comparatively
rare in Pennsylvania, though abundant in the southern counties
of New Jersey, and in Delaware, Eastern Maryland, and Virginia. It is
also abundant in the Carolinas, in Georgia, Florida, and the Gulf States.</p>

<p>Wilson, in describing the nest and eggs of this species, has evidently confounded
them and some of their habits with those of the Blue Grosbeak.
Their eggs are not light-blue, nor are the nests, so far as I know, as described
by him. Audubon and Nuttall copy substantially his errors.</p>

<p>The food of this species during the spring and early summer is chiefly
various kinds of large coleopterous insects, bees, wasps, and others. Later in
the season, when whortleberries are ripe, they feed chiefly on these and other
small fruit. In taking its food it rarely alights on the ground, but prefers to
capture its insects while on the wing.</p>

<p>The usual note of this bird, which Mr. Audubon pronounces unmusical,
resembles the sounds “<i class="birdcall">chicky-chucky-chuck</i>.” The same writer states that during
the spring this bird sings pleasantly for nearly half an hour in succession,
that its song resembles that of the Red-eyed Vireo, and that its notes are
sweeter and more varied and nearly equal to those of the Orchard Oriole.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Gerhardt of Varnell’s Station, in Northern Georgia, informed
me that these birds are quite common in that section of country. The nest
is usually built on one of the lower limbs of a post-oak, or in a pine sapling,
at a height of from six to twenty feet. They are usually constructed toward
the extremity of the limb, and so far from the trunk as to be very difficult of
access. They are generally built from the middle to the end of May. The
eggs are four in number.</p>

<p>In Southern Illinois, according to Mr. Ridgway, the Summer Redbird
arrives about the 20th of April, staying until the last of September. It is
more abundant than the Scarlet Tanager, and much less retiring in its habits,
<!--509.png--><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 444]</span>
frequenting the open groves instead of the deeper woods and the forests of
the bottom-lands, being especially attached to the parks and groves within the
towns. From its similarity in appearance, manners, and notes to the Scarlet
Tanager, it is seldom distinguished by the common people from that bird,
and those who notice the difference in color between the two generally consider
this the younger stage of plumage of the black-winged species. Its
song is said to be somewhat after the style of the Robin, but in a firmer
tone and more continued. It differs from the song of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. rubra</i> in being
more vigorous, and delivered in a manner less faltering. Its ordinary note of
anxiety when the nest is approached is a peculiar <i class="birdcall">pa-chip´it-tūt-tūt-tūt</i>, very
different from the weaker <i class="birdcall">chip´-al, rā-rēē</i> of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. rubra</i>. The nest is placed
on a low horizontal or drooping branch, near its extremity, the tree being
generally an oak, or sometimes a hickory, and situated near the roadside or at
the edge of a grove. In its construction it is described as very thin, though
by no means frail, permitting the eggs to be seen through the interstices
from below. Mr. Ridgway never found more than three eggs in one nest.</p>

<p>A nest of this species (<abbr title="Smithsonian Collection">Smith. Coll.</abbr>, 589) from Prairie Mer Rouge, Louisiana,
has a diameter of four inches and a height of two. Like all the nests
of this family, the cavity is very shallow, its deepest depression being hardly
half an inch. So far from corresponding with the descriptions generally
given of it, this nest is well and even strongly put together, although a portion
of the base and some of the external parts are somewhat openly interwoven,
as if for ventilation. These materials are fragments of plants, catkins,
leaves, stems, and grasses. These seem to constitute a distinct part of
the nest, and are of unequal thicknesses in different parts of the structure.
Within this external frame is a much more artistic and elaborately interwoven
basket, composed entirely of fine, slender, and dry grasses, homogeneous
in character, and evidently gathered just at the time its seed was ripening.
It is of a bright straw-yellow, and forms the whole internal portion of the
nest.</p>

<p>The eggs vary somewhat in size and shape, from an oblong to a rounded
oval. Their length is from .80 of an inch to an inch, and their breadth
averages .68. Their color is a bright light shade of emerald-green, spotted,
marbled, dotted, and blotched with various shades of lilac, brownish-purple,
and dark-brown. These are generally well diffused equally over the entire
egg.</p>

different from the throat, and abruptly lighter than the back, which, with the wings

slaty-umber, primaries faintly margined terminally with paler (in the type, this character
is not apparent, owing to the feathers being somewhat worn; in other specimens,
however, it is quite a noticeable feature, although possibly not to be entirely relied on).
<i class="sex">Female.</i> Above orange-olivaceous, beneath more light yellowish, purest medially; crissum
richer yellow than other lower parts, being in some individuals (young males?)
intense Indian-yellow, with the inner webs of the tail-feathers margined with the same;
quite distinct line of orange-yellow over the lores.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Upper Rio Grande and Colorado region of Southern Middle Province; south, in

<p>This bird, quite different from Eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æstiva</i>, is, however, probably only a
representative form of the same species in the Colorado and Upper Rio
Grande region, migrating south in winter, through Western Mexico to
Colima, as specimens from Texas and Middle Mexico appear to be quite
intermediate, at least in form.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This is a new form, whose claim to distinctness was first made
known by Mr. Ridgway, in 1869. In appearance, it most resembles the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.
æstiva</i>, but is larger. It has been found in the Middle Province of the United
States, from Fort Mohave at the north, to Colima and Mazatlan in Mexico.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found this bird quite common near Fort Mohave, after April
25, in the Colorado Valley, latitude 35<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. They chiefly frequented the tall
cottonwood, feeding on insects, and occasionally flew down to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Larrea</i>
bushes after a kind of bee found on them. He states also that they have
a call-note sounding like the words <i class="birdcall">ke-dik</i>, which, in the language of the
Mojave Indians, signifies “come here.” They sing in a loud, clear tone, and
in a style much like that of the Robin, but with a power of ventriloquism
which makes the sound appear much more distant than it really is. The
only specimens of this species known to have been obtained in the United
States were taken at Los Pinos, New Mexico, by Dr. Coues, and at Fort
Mohave by Dr. Cooper. Other specimens have been procured from Western
Mexico.</p>

Wings very long and much pointed; generally one third longer than the more
or less forked tail; first quill usually nearly as long as or longer than the second. Tertiaries
but little longer, or equal to the secondaries, and always much exceeded by the
primaries. Bill very variable in shape and size, the upper mandible, however, as broad as
the lower; nostrils rather more lateral than usual; and always more or less concealed by
a series of small bristly feathers applied along the base of the upper mandible; no bristles

at the base of the bill. Feet short and rather weak. Hind claw usually considerably
longer than the middle anterior one; sometimes nearly the same size.</p>

<p>In the preceding diagnosis I have combined a number of forms, all agreeing
in the length and acuteness of the wing, the bristly feathers along the
base of the bill, the absence of conspicuous bristles on the sides of the
mouth, and the shortness of the feet. They are all strongly marked and
brightly colored birds, and usually belong to the more northern regions.</p>

<p>The bill is very variable, even in the same genus, and its shape is to a
considerable extent of specific rather than of generic importance. The fringe
of short bristles along the base of the bill, concealing the nostrils, is not
appreciable in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plectrophanes</i> (except in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. nivalis</i>), but the other characteristics

<p>The variety with broad frontal band and increased amount of white appears
to characterize Northern specimens, while that with narrow frontlet and the
greatest amount of black is found in
Guatemala, Mexico, and the southern
Rocky Mountains, and may be called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">montana</i>.</p>

<p>In size it is also a little smaller. Specimens
from Mirador (where breeding) and
those from New Mexico are nearly identical
in size, proportions, and colors.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This remarkable Grosbeak
was first described by Mr. William Cooper,
from specimens obtained by Mr. Schoolcraft
in April, 1823, near the Sault Sainte
Marie, in Michigan. Sir John Richardson
soon after found it to be a common
inhabitant of the maple groves on the
plains of the Saskatchewan, where it is
called by the Indians the “Sugar-Bird.” He states that it frequents the
borders of Lake Superior also, and the eastern declivity of the Rocky Mountains,
in latitude 56<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>.</p>

<p>Captain Blakiston did not find this Grosbeak on the Saskatchewan during
the summer, but only noticed it there during the winter. He saw none after
the <abbr title="twenty-second">22d</abbr> of April, and not again until the middle of November. They were
seen in company with the Pine Grosbeak, feeding on the keys of the ash-leaved
maple. He adds that it has a sharp clear note in winter, and is an
active bird.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper, in his Notes on the Zoölogy of Washington Territory, states
that this species is a common resident in its forests, but adds that as it frequents
the summits of the tallest trees, its habits have been but little
observed. In January, 1854, during a snow-storm, a flock descended to some
<!--518.png--><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 451]</span>
low bushes at Vancouver, and began to eat the seeds. Since then he had
only seen them flying high among the tops of the poplars, upon the seeds of
which they feed. They were uttering their loud, shrill call-notes as they flew.</p>

<p>The same writer, in his Report on the birds of California, makes mention
of the occurrence of this Grosbeak at Michigan Bluffs, in Placer County, in
about latitude 39<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. Specimens were obtained by Mr. F. Gruber, and were
probably the variety designated as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">montana</i>. The same form doubtless
occurs along the summits of the Sierra Nevada, and they have been traced
among the Rocky Mountains to Fort Thorn in New Mexico.</p>

<p>These birds do not come down near the sea-coast even at the mouth of
the Columbia, and in California have not been met with in the Coast Range.
They are said to feed chiefly on the seeds of the pine, spruce, and cottonwood
trees, occasionally seeking other seeds near the ground. They are
silent when feeding, but utter a loud call-note as they fly from place to
place. In spring, Dr. Cooper states, they have a short but melodious song,
resembling that of the Robin or Black-headed Grosbeak. He afterwards
met with a flock in the winter near Santa Cruz, where they remained until
the end of April. Their favorite resort was a small grove of alders and willows,
close to the town, where their loud call-notes could be heard at all
times of the day, though he never heard them sing. In the early spring
their favorite food was the young leaves of various wild plants that grew
under the trees. They also fed on the buds of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Negundo</i>, and frequented
the large pear-trees in the old mission garden. They were very tame, and
allowed an approach to within a few yards, when feeding. Mr. Townsend, in
1836, found this Grosbeak abundant about the Columbia River. Late in
May they were quite numerous in the pine woods. They were very unsuspicious
and tame. Under the impression that these birds were only musical
towards night, they have been styled the Evening Grosbeak. But this, according
to Mr. Townsend, is a misnomer. He also contraverts several other
statements made in reference to their habits. He found them remarkably
noisy from morning until night, when they quietly retire like other birds,
and are not heard from until the next day-dawn. They go in large flocks,
and are rarely met with singly. As they feed upon the seeds of the pine and
other trees, they proceed by a succession of hops to the extremities of the
branches. They also feed largely on the larvæ of the large black ant, for
which object they frequent the tops of the low oaks on the edges of the
forests. Their ordinary voice is said to be a single screaming note, uttered
while feeding. At times, about midday, the male attempts a song, which Mr.
Townsend describes as a miserable failure. It is a single note, a warbling
call like the first note of the Robin, but not so sweet, and suddenly checked,
as if the performer were out of breath.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumichrast met with the variety of this species designated as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">montana</i>,
May, 1857, in the pine woods of Monte Alto, about twelve leagues from
Mexico; and although he has never found it in the alpine region of Vera
<!--519.png--><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 452]</span>
Cruz, he thinks it probable it will be found to be a resident of that district.</p>

<p>Lake Superior has been stated to be its most eastern point of occurrence,
but, though this may be true as a general rule, several instances of the
accidental appearance of this nomadic species much farther to the east are
known. On February 14, 1871, Mr. Kumlien, while out in the woods with
his son, saw a small flock of these birds in Dane County, Wisconsin. There
were six of them, but, having no gun, he did not procure any. Later in the
season he again met with and secured specimens. In the following March,
Dr. Hoy of Racine also obtained several near that city. He also informs me
that during the winter of 1870-71 there were large flocks of these birds
near Freeport, <abbr title="Illinois">Ill.</abbr> One person procured twenty-four specimens. One season
he noticed them as late as May. They frequent the maple woods, and feed
on the seeds fallen on the ground. They also eat the buds of the wild cherry.
Their visits are made at irregular intervals. In some years not a single individual
can be seen, while in others they make their appearance in December
and continue through the whole winter.</p>

<p>Specimens have also been obtained near Cleveland, Ohio, and at Hamilton,
Canada; and Mr. Thomas McIlwraith states that Mr. T. J. Cottle of Woodstock,
Ontario, shot several of these birds in his orchard in the month of
May. They were quite numerous, and remained about the place several
days.</p>

A considerable number of specimens from Kodiak (perhaps to be found in
other localities on the northwest coast) compared with eastern have conspicuously
larger bills, almost equal to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cardinalis</i> in this respect. In <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 54,465
the length from forehead is .80; from nostril, .50; from gape, .66; gonys, .40;
greatest depth, .51. In a Brooklyn
skin (12,846) the same measurements
are from forehead, .60; from nostril,
.44; from gape, .60; gonys, .34; greatest
depth, .40. A Saskatchewan skin
is intermediate. A European specimen
has the bill as long as that from
Kodiak, but less swollen. A Himalayan
species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. subhimachalus</i>) is
much smaller, and differently colored.</p>

<p>These Kodiak specimens approach
the European bird more nearly in
form of the bill, in which there is a
tendency to a more abruptly hooked
upper mandible than in the birds
from the eastern portions of British
America. As a general thing, the
red tint is brighter in American than in European birds.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Pine Grosbeak is, to a large extent, a resident of the portions
of North America north of the United States. In the northern parts
of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, as well as in western
America, it is found throughout the year in the dark evergreen forests. In
the winter it is an irregular visitant as far south as Philadelphia, being in
some seasons very abundant, and again for several winters quite rare.</p>

<p>Mr. Boardman mentions it as abundant, in the winter, about Calais, and
Mr. Verrill gives it as quite common in the vicinity of Norway. It is
found every winter more or less frequently in Eastern Massachusetts, though
Mr. Allen regards it as rare in the vicinity of Springfield. It is not cited
by Dr. Cooper as a bird of Washington Territory, but he mentions it as
not uncommon near the summits of the Sierra Nevada, latitude 39<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, in September.
It probably breeds there, as he found two birds in that region in
the young plumage. They were feeding on spruce seeds when he first saw
them, and lingered even after their companions had been shot, and allowed
him to approach within a few feet of them.</p>

<p>Mr. R. Brown (Ibis, 1868) states that during the winter of 1866, while
snow was lying on the ground, two pairs of this species were shot at Fort
Rupert, Vancouver Island.</p>

<p>Wilson met with occasional specimens of these birds in the vicinity of
Philadelphia, generally in immature plumage, and kept one several months,
to note any change in its plumage. In the summer it lost all its red colors
<!--524.png--><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 455]</span>
and became of a greenish-yellow. In May and June, its song, though
not so loud as that of some birds, was extremely clear, mellow, and sweet.
This song it warbled out for the whole morning, and also imitated the notes
of a Cardinal, that hung near it. It became exceedingly tame and familiar,
and when in want of food or water, uttered a continual melancholy and
anxious note.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1835, and for several following seasons, these birds were
exceedingly abundant in the vicinity of Boston. They appeared early in
December, and remained until quite late in March, feeding chiefly on the
berries of the red cedar. They were so unsuspecting and familiar that it was
often possible to capture them alive in butterfly-nets, and to knock them down
with poles. Large numbers were destroyed and brought to market, and many
were taken alive and caged. They were tame, but unhappy in confinement,
uttering mournful cries as the warm weather approached. In the winter
of 1869-70 they again made their appearance in extraordinary numbers,
in a few localities on the sea-coast of Massachusetts, where they did considerable
damage to the fruit-buds of the apple and pear.</p>

<p>Sir John Richardson states that this bird was not observed by his expedition
higher than the 60th parallel. It lives, for the most part, a very retired
life, in the deepest recesses of the pine forests, where it passes the entire
year, having been found by Mr. Drage, near York Fort, on the 25th of January,
1747. Richardson adds that it builds its nest on the lower branches of
trees, and feeds chiefly on the seeds of the white spruce.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues speaks of it as not at all rare along the coast of Labrador, where
he obtained several specimens. It was confined entirely to the thick woods
and patches of scrubby juniper. A female remained unconcernedly on a
twig after he had shot her mate, uttering continually a low soft <i class="birdcall">shep</i>, like
that of the Fox-colored Sparrow. Another note was a prolonged whirring
chirrup, uttered in a rather low tone, apparently a note of recognition.</p>

<p>A lady resident in Newfoundland informed Mr. Audubon that she had
kept several of these Grosbeaks in confinement, that they soon became very
familiar, would sing during the night, feeding, during the summer, on all
kinds of fruit and berries, and in the winter on different seeds. Mr. Audubon
also often observed that, when firing at one of their number, the others,
instead of flying away, would move towards him, often to within a few feet,
and remain on the lower branches of the trees, gazing at him in curiosity,
entirely unmingled with any sense of their own danger. Mr. Audubon quotes
from Mr. McCulloch, of Pictou, an interesting account of the habits of one
of these birds, kept in confinement. The winter had been very severe, the
storms violent, and, in consequence of the depth of snow, many birds had
perished from hunger and cold. The Grosbeaks, driven from the woods,
sought food around the barns and outhouses, and crowded the streets of
Pictou. One of these, taken in a starving condition, soon became so tame as
to feed from his hand, lived at large in his chamber, and would awaken him
<!--525.png--><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 456]</span>
early in the morning to receive his allowance of seed. As spring approached,
he began to whistle in the morning, and his notes were exceedingly rich and
full. As the time came when his mates were moving north, his familiarity
entirely disappeared, and he sought constantly, by day and by night, to escape
by dashing against the window-panes, and during the day filled the house
with his piteous wailing cries, refusing his food, so that in pity he was let
out. But no sooner was he thus released than he seemed indifferent to the
privilege, and kept about the door so persistently that he had at last to be
driven away, lest some accident should befall him.</p>

<p>The Pine Grosbeaks were found by Bischoff at Sitka and at Kodiak, and
are said by Mr. Dall to be extremely common near Nulato, and wherever
there are trees throughout the Yukon Territory. They frequent groves of
willow and poplar, near open places, and especially the water-side in winter,
and in summer seek more retired places for breeding. Their crops, when
opened, were always found to contain the hearts of the buds of poplars, with
the external coverings carefully rejected, and were never found to include
anything else. Mr. Dall noticed no song, only a twitter and a long chirp. He
found them excellent as an article of food. European eggs of this bird, taken
by Mr. Wolley in Finland in 1858, are of an oblong-oval shape, and have a
light slate-colored ground with a marked tinge of greenish, broadly marked
and plashed with faint, subdued cloudy patches of brownish-purple, and sparingly
spotted, chiefly at the larger end, with blackish-brown and dark purple.
They measure 1.02 inches in length by .70 in breadth.</p>

<p>No positively identified eggs of the American Pine Grosbeak are as
yet known in collections, but Mr. Boardman has found a nest, near Calais,
about which there can be little doubt, although the parent was not seen.
This was placed in an alder-bush in a wet meadow, and was about four
feet from the ground. It was composed entirely of coarse green mosses.
The eggs were two, and were not distinguishable from those of the
European <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">enucleator</i>.</p>

claws about equal.</p>

<p>This genus is closely related to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinicola</i>, but has a more swollen and much

longer, the tail less emarginate. Other differences exist in the grooves and
ridges of the palate, which need not be here referred to. The middle claw
is about equal to hind claw; not longer, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinicola</i>.</p>

<p>The genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyrrhula</i> is an Old
World one; extending across
from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
six or eight species or varieties
being recognized by naturalists.
All have the back ash-colored;
the wings and tail, with top of
head, lustrous black; the under
parts ash, generally with vermilion
on the cheeks and chin, sometimes extending over the whole under
surface; the rump and crissum white: the females similar, but lacking the
vermilion. Its introduction into the North American fauna rests on the collecting
by the naturalists of the Russian Telegraph Expedition in Alaska of
a specimen which&mdash;if a full-plumaged male, as stated&mdash;differs from all of
its congeners in the entire absence of any vermilion tint.</p>

<p>The specimen referred to above is the first record of the occurrence in
America of a genus heretofore considered as belonging exclusively to the
Old World.</p>

<p>This bird was described in 1869 as a possible variety of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. coccinea</i> of
Europe. On submitting the typical specimens to Mr. H. B. Tristram of
England, it was decided to be a well-marked and distinct species, as explained
in the following extract from a letter received from him.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The coloration of the back is the same as in males of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. coccinea</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. rubicilla</i>, and differs from the coloration of the <abbr title="female symbol">♀</abbr> in all three species. In
all the <abbr title="female symbol">♀</abbr> has the back brown instead of slate-colored. Your bird, however,
differs from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. coccinea</i> in having the under parts of the same color as the <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. griseiventris</i> with a slightly redder hue on the flanks, while <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. coccinea</i>
is a brilliant blazing red. In this your bird is like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. murina</i> of the Azores,
but that has no white on the rump.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Nor can it be <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr> <abbr class="juvenile" title="juvenile">juv.</abbr> of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. coccinea</i>, because it has the <em>black</em> head, and the
young assumes the black head and red breast simultaneously, or rather the
red begins first. It differs from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. nipalensis</i> in having a black head and
broad white rump, as well as in size.”</p>

<p>Dr. O. Finsch, of Bremen, agrees with Mr. Tristram in considering it as
specifically distinct, and says that the long white shaft-streak on the outermost
tail-feather is to be considered as one of the peculiar characters, and
that in general it resembles the female of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. griseiventris</i>, <abbr title="Lafresnaye"><span class="sc">Lafr.</span></abbr>, but differs

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. coccinea</i> of Europe, was obtained by Mr. Dall, near Nulato, Alaska, January
10, 1867. An Indian brought it in alive, but badly wounded, having shot it
from a small tree near the fort. He had never seen anything like it before,
nor had any of the Russians. Captain Everett Smith had, however, met with
several flocks of the same species near Ulukuk. This specimen was a male,
with black eyes, feet, and bill, and was the only bird of the kind met with
by Mr. Dall.</p>

<p>In size it is about equal to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. coccinea</i>, which is now quite generally considered
to be simply a large race of the common Bullfinch (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. vulgaris</i>), and
the habits of the American bird are doubtless similar to those of its congeners.
The European races inhabit the mountainous regions of Northern
and Central Europe, appearing in large flocks in December and January in
the more southern regions. In their return in spring to their summer quarters,
they move in smaller numbers. They nest in the mountain forests, on
trees or bushes. Their nest is usually but a few feet from the ground, is
beautifully wrought in a cup shape, made externally of small twigs, blades of
grass, and rootlets, lined with coarse hair. They lay five eggs, the ground-color
of which shades from a light blue to a bluish or a greenish white, with
<!--528.png--><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 459]</span>
brown and violet-colored spots, that usually form a ring around the larger
end. Their food is grain and small seeds, and, in spring, the buds of certain
trees.</p>

<p>The Bullfinch is a favorite cage-bird, soon reconciled to confinement, and
capable of being taught to whistle whole airs of opera music with wonderful
exactness and beauty.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Cassin’s Purple Finch is the largest of the American birds of
this genus, and is not only conspicuously
different from all in size, but also in other
respects. It is found between the great Central
Plains and the coast range of mountains,
being one of the common birds of Colorado,
Utah, Nevada, and Eastern California. Dr.
Cooper found these birds in large numbers
about Lake Tahoe in California. They were
all in their brown plumage, and seemed so
much like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. californicus</i> in their habits
that he mistook them for that species. He
noticed in them a very peculiar call-note as
they flew, reminding him of that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyranga</i>,
and quite different from the other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carpodaci</i>. The song of these birds,
as he afterwards heard it, was much louder and finer than that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. californicus</i>,
and more original in style. He is not familiar with their other
habits, and has never met with them in the Colorado Valley. They have
been procured from Fort Thorne, Pueblo Creek, and Alberquerque, New
Mexico. Mr. Ridgway met with these birds in the Wahsatch Mountains,
June 26, 1869, in Parley’s Park, Utah, where he found them breeding.
Their nest was in the top of a cottonwood-tree near the cañon stream, about
forty feet from the ground. It is a soft homogeneous structure, flattened in
shape, and with only a slight depression. It is composed principally of roots
and twigs, lined with softer materials of the same, interspersed with moss,
cotton, and other soft substances. It is two inches in height with a width
of four and a half inches. The cavity is about an inch deep.</p>

<p>In his Report on the birds of Mr. King’s survey, Mr. Ridgway states that
he found this Linnet in the greatest abundance among the pines of the Sierra
Nevada, near Carson City. It was next seen among the cedars and nut-pines
of the East Humboldt Mountains, and again in the pine woods and cottonwood-trees
along the streams on the Wahsatch Mountains. It breeds in all
these localities, and is in its habits essentially, though not exclusively, resident
among the pines. March 21, 1868, Mr. Ridgway observed flocks of
these birds near Carson City. They were found in every portion of the
woods, feeding among the branches of the pine-trees. They were all in full
song, the females as well as the males. A week later he again found them
common among the isolated pines in the fields at the foot of the Sierras,
alighting on the trees in companies. Their notes resemble the song of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C.
purpureus</i>, but are finer and more musical. They have a great resemblance
<!--531.png--><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 462]</span>
to the warblings of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireo flavifrons</i>, but the passages in its song as much
excel those of the Vireo in sweetness as they are surpassed in richness by
the warblings of the latter. When one of two females of this species had
been killed, the survivor, missing her companion, returned immediately to
the tree and hopped from branch to branch, and then alighted on the ground
by the side of her dead associate, lamenting her in sweet and plaintive cries.</p>

<p>By the 4th of April the pine-trees about Carson City were alive with
these handsome birds, all of whom were in full song. So many were singing
simultaneously that the chorus was almost deafening, yet was most exquisitely
pleasing.</p>

<p>The nests of this bird were found by Mr. Ridgway in various situations,
such as a box-elder bush, the tops of cottonwood and aspen trees, and similar
situations. The eggs, four in number, are in size .82 by .63 of an inch,
oval in shape, pointed at the smaller end, of a light bluish-green ground, dotted
around the larger end with slate, lilac, and a blackish-brown.</p>

<p>Specimens were obtained by Dr. Sartorius, during the breeding-season
(June, 1864), in the pine forests of <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr> Orizaba. A careful comparison
shows no difference from birds procured in the same month in Nevada.</p>

parallels is a rather common bird in suitable localities. A few are occasionally
found during the winter in Massachusetts, but usually they all pass farther
south. In the State of South Carolina they are especially abundant
throughout the winter, or from October until April.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues states that the Purple Finch is a very abundant winter resident
near Washington, arriving early in October and remaining until May, being
eminently gregarious. Stragglers were seen until nearly June, but the majority
had departed as the leaves expanded. They were most common in high
open woods, and were observed to feed chiefly on tender young buds of trees.
They were in full song before they took their departure.</p>

<p>They make their first appearance in regular migrations, in Massachusetts,
from the 10th to the 20th of May, and occasionally a few are seen earlier.
They are often unwelcome visitors to the fruit-growers, having a great fondness
for the blossoms of the peach, cherry, plum, and apple. They will also
feed upon other kinds of buds and blossoms. They have a great predilection
for evergreen trees, especially the fir, the spruce, and the red cedar,
and most generally build their nests in these trees. In summer they feed on
seeds, insects, and berries of the honeysuckle and other shrubs.</p>

<p>The Purple Finch, or, as it is generally known in New England, the Linnet,
is one of our sweetest, best, and most constant songsters, and is often trapped
and sold as caged birds. They soon become accustomed and partially reconciled
to their confinement, but sing only during a small part of the year.
When one of these birds, confined in a cage, is hung outside the house,
in the country, he is sure to draw around him quite a number of his species,
and this furnishes the dealer a ready means of capturing them.</p>

<p>This Finch was once regarded as quite rare in the vicinity of Boston, so
much so that during a four years’ residence in Cambridge, when collections
of nests and eggs had many votaries, not a single nest of this species was
obtained by any one. Since then, from some cause, probably the increase of
gardens, groves of evergreens, and other localities favorable for their preservation
and reproduction, these graceful little Finches have become quite abundant
in places propitious for their residence. No less than seven pairs of
these favorite songsters took up their abode in my grounds at Hingham in a
single summer, and two had nests in the same tree, one of which was at least
sixty feet from the ground, on the very top of a tall fir. These several pairs,
as a general thing, lived together very harmoniously, save only when one
would approach too near the favorite station of another, when the latter
would begin to bristle up his crest, and give very evident hints that his near
presence was not agreeable. The extreme southern end of the ridge-pole of
the house had been, for several summers, the favorite post for the patriarch
of the flock, from which at morning and at evening he made the neighborhood
vocal with his melody. If in his absence any other of these birds
ventured to occupy his position, there was always sure to be a disturbance on
his return, if it was not instantly vacated. These encounters were frequent,
<!--533.png--><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 464]</span>
and always very amusing. Discretion usually took the place of valor on the
part of the intruder.</p>

<p>The song of the Purple Finch resembles that of the Canary, and though
less varied and powerful, is softer, sweeter, and more touching and pleasing.
The notes of this species may be heard from the last of May until late in
September, and in the long summer evenings are often continued until after
it is quite dark. Their song has all the beauty and pathos of the Warbling
Vireo, and greatly resembles it, but is more powerful and full in tone. It is
a very interesting sight to watch one of these little performers in the midst
of his song. He appears perfectly absorbed in his work, his form dilates,
his crest is erected, his throat expands, and he seems to be utterly unconscious
of all around him. But let an intruder of his own race appear within
a few feet of the singer, and the song instantly ceases, and in a violent fit
of indignation he chases him away.</p>

<p>The flight of the Purple Finch is said by Mr. Audubon to resemble that
of the Green Finch of Europe. They fly in compact flocks, with an undulating
motion, alighting all at once, and then instantly, as if suddenly
alarmed, take again to flight only to return to the same tree. They then
immediately make each his separate way to the ends of the branches, and
commence eating the buds. The food they take to their young is juicy berries
and the softer portions of the young cones of the fir and spruce.</p>

<p>They nest generally in firs, spruces, or cedar-trees, though occasionally on
the upper branches of a high apple-tree. Their nests are usually placed upon
a branch, rather than interlaced between its forked twigs. I have known
them not more than five feet from the ground, and at other times on the highest
point of a lofty fir-tree. The nests are, for the most part, somewhat flat
and shallow structures, not more than two and a half inches in height, and
about three and a half in breadth. The walls of the nest average less than
an inch, and the cavity corresponds to its general shape and form. The
framework of the nest is usually made of small denuded vegetable fibres,
stems of grasses, strips of bark, and woody fragments. The upper rim of the
nest is often a curious intertwining of dry herbaceous stems, the ends of which
project above the nest itself in the manner of a low palisade. The inner nest
is made up of minute vegetable fibres, closely interwoven. There is usually no
other lining than this. At other times these nests are largely made up of small
dark-colored rootlets of wooded plants, lined with finer materials of the same,
occasionally mingled with the down of birds and the fur of small animals.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Purple Finch vary greatly in size, and somewhat in shape.
Generally they are of an oblong oval, pointed considerably at one end. Their
length varies from .92 to .81 of an inch, and their breadth from .70 to .60.
Their color is a pale shade of emerald-green, spotted with dark brown, almost
black, chiefly about the larger end. The ground-color is much brighter when
the eggs are fresh, and soon fades upon exposure to light, and even when kept
in a close drawer.</p>

<p>The female of the western type differs from that of the eastern in
being more olivaceous above, and in having the streaks below rather larger,
and not so well defined. There appears to be a difference in the marking
of the wings. In eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. purpureus</i> there is usually a well-marked whitish
band across the ends of the middle coverts, while the greater coverts,
though margined externally by paler, have a still lighter bar across the posterior
extremity, which is not seen in the western bird.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Californian Purple Pinch is found throughout the Pacific
coast, from the Straits of Fuca to California, as far south as Monterey. Dr.
Cooper states that this species is rather a northern bird, being common at the
Columbia River, and even farther north, while in California it has not been
found south of Monterey on the coast, and Fort Tejon in the Sierra Nevada.
In summer they frequent the mountain forests, especially those in part composed
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coniferæ</i>. In winter they descend to the valleys, where they are
found associating with the more common and familiar <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. frontalis</i>. He met
with them in May on the summits of the coast range toward Santa Cruz,
but they were not very numerous. They then had nests, though he did not
succeed in finding them.</p>

<p>The song of the California Linnet is quite loud and varied, often resembling
that of other birds, especially <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireos</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendroicæ</i>, for which Dr.
Cooper has often mistaken it. Their food consists of seeds, berries, and the
buds of trees. Their nest and eggs are unknown, but probably resemble
those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. purpureus</i>.</p>

and abdomen with broad streaks of dusky. General color above, including wings,

white, each feather with a medial streak of dusky. <i class="sex">Male.</i> A broad frontal crescent, extending
back in a superciliary stripe to the occiput, a patch on the rump (not the upper tail-coverts),

Wing-coverts broadly edged with light earth-brown.</p>

<p>This species inhabits the western regions of North America, from the
Rocky Mountains to the Pacific; and Mexico, except, perhaps, the eastern
portion. In this range of distribution it occurs in three races, which, taking
extreme examples, are well marked, but when a large series is examined are
found to grade insensibly into each other.</p>

<p>The above description is general, being modified only by <em>additional</em> characters
in the several races. The normal plumage is perhaps represented in the
central race,&mdash;the true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">frontalis</i>, as restricted,&mdash;which inhabits the Middle
Province of the United States, and is nearly as described above; the red of
the male of this style is of a bright scarlet tint, and in nearly all specimens
shows a tendency to escape the boundaries above indicated. As we go south
into Mexico, we find the red strictly confined within those limits, very sharply
defined; and, under the tropical influence, intensified into a very bright carmine
tint; this latter is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. hæmorrhous</i> of authors. Following the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">frontalis</i> westward, we find it gradually changing, the red invading more and
more the other portions, until, in specimens from the coast of California and
from Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, it is spread over all portions, except the anal region,
wing, and tail,&mdash;though always brightest within those outlines which confine
it in the two preceding varieties. In extreme examples of the latter
race,&mdash;the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. rhodocolpus</i> of Cabanis,&mdash;the red even obliterates the streaks
on the abdomen. The spreading of the red is seen in other birds of the Pacific
region, this case being exactly paralleled by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphyropicus ruber</i>, in its
relation to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. nuchalis</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. varius</i>.</p>

<p>The females and young of the three races are quite difficult to distinguish
from each other, the locality being the best means of identifying them.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Middle Province of the United States, from Rocky Mountains to the interior
valleys of California.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This form of the House Finch appears to be a very common bird
throughout the interior region of the United States, extending to New Mexico
and Arizona on the south and southeast, and probably to Mexico. On
the Pacific coast it is replaced by another and closely allied variety.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse states that his attention was first called to this interesting
little songster while at Sante Fé. It was there known to the American residents
as the “Adobe Finch.” By the Mexicans they were called <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Buriones</i>.
He found them exceedingly tame, building about the dwellings, churches,
and other buildings, in every nook and corner, and even entering the houses
to pick up crumbs. They are never disturbed by the inhabitants. He adds
that at the first dawn of the morning they commence a very sweet and clear
warble, which he was quite unable to do justice to by any verbal description.
He has often in the early morning listened with admiration and gratification
to the song of this bird, which is deservedly a great favorite. He found it
throughout New Mexico, and beyond. He did not distinguish it from the
coast variety.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues also found this bird very abundant in Arizona, where it is a
permanent resident, but most abundant in spring and fall. He describes it as
eminently gregarious. He found it in all situations, but most common in the
spring among the groves of willows and poplars, on the buds of which it feeds.
He met with this species all the way from the Rio Grande through New
Mexico and Arizona to California, and appears to have noted no differences
between this form and the coast variety. He also mentions finding, during a
few days’ stay in the New Mexican village of Los Pinos, near Alberquerque,
on the Rio Grande, this pretty little Finch the most common and characteristic
of the local birds. It was there breeding indifferently in the courtyards,
sheds, under porticos or eaves, and also in the forks of trees in
the streets. It had sharp conflicts with the Barn Swallows, whose nests it
<!--537.png--><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 468]</span>
often took possession of, and was a lively and most agreeable feature in the
dirty towns which it honored with its presence; and its songs were at once
sweet, clear, and exquisitely melodious.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper met with these birds among the barren and rocky hills near
the Colorado.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway, who found these birds breeding in large numbers at Pyramid
Lake, informs me that their nests were usually placed in clefts in rocks,
or in a cave. Near Salt Lake City they were also very common, building
their nests among the shrubs known as the wild mahogany, on the hills, but
never frequenting the higher regions of the mountains.</p>

<p>The eggs of this bird, which are not distinguishable from those of the
Pacific coast form, have a delicate pale-blue ground-color, which is very
fugitive, and fades even in the drawers of a cabinet. They are sparingly
marked, chiefly around the more obtuse end, with spots and lines of black
and a dark brown. They are of oval shape, elongate and pointed at one end,
and measure .80 of an inch in length by .60 in breadth.</p>

Coast region of Pacific Province, and peninsula of Lower California.</p>

<p>The male described above represents about the average plumage of this
form; an extreme example is <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 26,546, Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, which is almost
entirely of a wine-red color, this covering the whole lower parts, except the
anal region, and obliterating the streaks; the wings even are tinged with
red. Still, on the head the red (a wine-purple tint) is brightest within those
limits to which it is confined in the normal plumage.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This variety of the House Finch is a very common bird throughout
the Pacific coast, from Oregon to Mexico. Mr. Ridgway states that he
found this species the most common and familiar of all the birds of the Sacramento
Valley. It is a very common cage-bird, being highly prized for its
song, which in power is hardly inferior to that of the Canary, while it far
<!--538.png--><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 469]</span>
surpasses it in sweetness. Its beautiful plumage also renders it still more
attractive. The peculiarly soft and musical <i class="birdcall">tweet</i> of this bird is also very
similar to that of the Canary, and is very different from the common note of
the Purple Finch. This bird breeds very numerously among the shade-trees
in the streets of Sacramento, as well as among the oak groves on the outskirts
of that city. The males are very shy, but the females, when their nest
is disturbed, keep up a lively chirping in an adjoining tree. The nest is generally
situated near the extremity of a horizontal branch of a small oak,
usually in a grove, occasionally in an isolated tree. In one instance it made
use of an abandoned nest of a Bullock’s Oriole, and in another of that of a
Cliff Swallow.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper speaks of this bird as being especially abundant in all the
southern portions of California, and also, according to Dr. Newberry, throughout
all the valleys northward into Oregon. It is a species that is everywhere
peculiar to the valleys, while the others of this genus are equally
confined to the wooded mountains. Dr. Cooper also met with this species
in the plains near the coast, where there are no plants higher than the wild
mustard, on the seeds of which they feed. They also frequent the groves
and the open forests on the summits of the coast range, but in small numbers,
in company with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. californicus</i>. They at times feed on buds of
trees, and seeds of the cottonwood and other plants. It is most abundant
among ranches and gardens where, Dr. Cooper states, it does much mischief
by destroying seeds and young plants, fruit and buds. For these depredations
even its cheerful and constant song is not regarded as an adequate compensation;
and unlike the New-Mexicans in their treatment of its kindred
race, the California cultivators wage an unrelenting war upon these birds.</p>

<p>At San Diego, Dr. Cooper found them building as early as the 15th of
March, and even a little earlier. Both the situation and the materials of
their nest vary. He has found them nesting in trees, on logs and rocks, on
the top rail of a picket fence, inside a window-shutter, in the holes of walls,
under tiles, on the thatch of a roof, in barns and haystacks, and even between
the interstices in the sticks of which the nest of a Hawk had been
made, and once in the old nest of an Oriole. About dwellings they always
seek the protection of man, and seem to be quite unconscious of having
deserved or incurred his enmity. The materials of their nests are usually
coarse grasses and weeds, with a lining of hair and fine roots. They raise
two, sometimes three, broods in a season, and in the autumn assemble in
large flocks, but migrate very little, if any, to the south.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper states that their songs are very different from those of the
other species. They are very varied and very lively, and are heard throughout
the year. They are easily kept as cage-birds, but soon lose the beauty
of their plumage in confinement, their bright purple colors changing to a
dirty yellow.</p>

<p>Nuttall did not observe any of this species in Oregon.</p>

<p><!--539.png--><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 470]</span>
The eggs of this bird vary from four to six in number, and are of a pale blue
which readily fades into a bluish-white, and are marked with spots and lines
of a dark brown or black. They are of an elongate-oval shape, and measure
from .82 to .75 of an inch in length, with an average breadth of .60.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common American Goldfinch is found throughout the
greater portion of North America, from
the Atlantic to the Pacific. Sir John
Richardson met with it in the fur regions,
where it is one of the tardiest of
the summer visitors, and whence it departs
early in September. The specimen
described by him was taken June
29. At the extreme South it is not
uncommon, according to Dresser, around
San Antonio, and Dr. Woodhouse found
it abundant both in Texas and in the
Indian Territory. Dr. Coues did not
find it in Arizona, nor does Sumichrast
give it as a bird of Vera Cruz. Dr. Newberry found this Finch quite common
throughout his route to the Columbia, this sweet songster, he states,
having been a constant source of pleasure in the interior both of California
and Oregon, far from the haunts of men, where everything else was new and
strange. But Dr. Suckley, though he looked carefully for this species about
Puget Sound, in the most appropriate situations, was unable to find any, and
did not believe that any existed there. Dr. Cooper states that it is, however,
quite abundant on the Columbia and along the coast near its mouth.</p>

<p>The last-named writer states that this species is a constant resident in all
the western parts of California, but he met with none on the Colorado. They
become rare on the coast at the Columbia, but farther in the interior are
found as far north as latitude 49<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. They breed as far south as San Diego,
but seem to avoid the hot interior valleys, as well as the mountains. Their
favorite resorts are where thistles and other composite plants abound, and
also groves of willow and cottonwood, upon the seeds of which they feed
largely. In winter the seeds of the buttonwood supply their chief subsistence.</p>

<p>The common Goldfinch was seen in abundance by Mr. Ridgway only in
the vicinity of Sacramento City, associated with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carpodacus frontalis</i>,
and often nesting in the same tree. In the interior this species was rarely
seen, and only one specimen was secured in the Truckee Valley in May, and
not noticed afterwards. It was, however, found breeding in the Uintah
<!--544.png--><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 473]</span>
Mountains, where its nest and eggs were obtained. The nests procured by
Mr. Ridgway were all found about June 6, except one, ten days later, showing
that these birds are four or five weeks earlier in their breeding on the
Pacific than on the Atlantic coast. In the Uintah Mountains they were
breeding, as at the East, in July.</p>

<p>The Goldfinch is to a large extent gregarious and nomadic in its habits,
and only for a short portion of the year do these birds separate into pairs for
the purposes of reproduction. During at least three fourths of the year they
associate in small flocks, and wander about in an irregular and uncertain
manner in quest of their food. They are resident throughout the year in
New England, and also throughout the greater portion of the country, their
presence or absence being regulated to a large extent by the abundance,
scarcity, or absence of their favorite kinds of food. In the winter, the seeds
of the taller weeds are their principal means of subsistence. In the summer,
the seeds of the thistle and other plants and weeds are sought out
by these interesting and busy gleaners. They are abundant in gardens, and
as a general thing do very little harm, and a vast amount of benefit in the
destruction of the seeds of troublesome weeds. As, however, they do not
always discriminate between seeds that are troublesome and those that are
desirable, the Goldfinches are unwelcome visitors to the farmers who seek to
raise their own seeds of the lettuce, turnip, and other similar vegetables.
They are also very fond of the seeds of the sunflower.</p>

<p>Owing possibly to the scarcity of proper food for their young in the early
summer, the Goldfinches are quite late before they mate and raise their single
brood. It is usually past the 10th of July before their nests are constructed,
and often September before their broods are ready to fly.</p>

<p>The song of the Goldfinch&mdash;very different from their usual plaintive cry
or call-note, uttered as they are flying or when they are feeding&mdash;is very
sweet, brilliant, and pleasing; most so, indeed, when given as a solo, with no
other of its kindred within hearing. I know of none of our common singers
that excel it in either respect. Its notes are higher and more flute-like, and
its song is more prolonged than that of the Purple Finch. Where large
flocks are found in the spring or early summer, the males often join in a very
curious and remarkable concert, in which the voices of the several performers
do not always accord. In spite of this frequent want of harmony, these concerts
are varied and pleasing, now ringing like the loud voices of the Canary,
and now sinking into a low soft warble.</p>

<p>During the warm summer weather the Goldfinch is very fond of bathing,
and the sandy shelving margins of brooks are always their favorite places
of resort for this purpose. I do not think they ever raise more than a single
brood in a season in New England, and are in this somewhat irregular, depositing
their eggs from July 10 to September, as it may happen.</p>

<p>They usually select a small upright tree, such as a young elm, apple, or
pear, or a tall shrub, for their nest, which they rarely place higher than ten
<!--545.png--><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 474]</span>
feet from the ground. Than the nest of our Goldfinch we have no more beautiful
specimen either of the basket in shape or the felted in structure. Symmetrical
in form, delicately and beautifully woven, and ingeniously and firmly
fastened around the forked twigs with which it is interlaced, it is an exquisite
example of architectural beauty and finish. A beautiful specimen from
Wisconsin may be taken as typical. It measures three inches in diameter
and two in height. The cavity is one and a half inches wide at the rim, and
the depth is the same. The base of this nest is a commingling of soft vegetable
wool, very fine stems of dried grasses, and fine strips of bark, all being
in very fine shreds. The sides, rim, and general exterior of the nest is made
up, to a large extent, of fine slender vegetable fibres, interwrought with
white and maroon-colored vegetable wool. These materials are closely and
densely felted together. The inner nest is softly and thoroughly lined with
a softer felting made of the plumose appendages or pappus of the seeds of
composite plants.</p>

<p>The eggs, usually five, rarely six in number, are of a uniform bluish-white,
sharply pointed at one and rounded at the other end. They measure from
.65 to .67 of an inch in length and from .50 to .55 in breadth. Dr. Cooper
gives their measurement as .60 by .50; but of the contents of seven nests
before me not an egg is less than .65 in length, and but one so small as .50
in breadth.</p>

<p>A nest of this Finch, built in a young elm-tree in Hingham, eight feet from
the ground, was begun July 27, finished and the first egg laid August 1. By
the 4th five eggs had been deposited, and on the 16th they had all been
hatched.</p>

With quite a small series of specimens, a perfect transition can be shown
from the typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. psaltria</i>, as above described, to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. columbianus</i>, the
opposite extreme (see table, page 471). The former is the most northern,
the latter the most southern form; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arizonæ</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mexicana</i>, intermediate
in habitat, are also as strikingly so in plumage. The difference is in the
<em>quantity</em> of the black, this color predominating over the olive of the back
and the white of wings and tail, in proportion as we go southward. There
cannot, upon the whole, be any doubt that they are all specifically the same.
The females can scarcely be distinguished.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Arkansas Finch was first discovered in Long’s expedition to
the Rocky Mountains, and described by Say in 1823. It has since been met
with in New Mexico and in various parts of California. Dr. Cooper did not
find this species in the Colorado Valley, although Dr. Kennerly met with
it along Williams Fork, in New Mexico. Dr. Woodhouse did not see it in
his route to the Zuñi River, either in New Mexico or the Indian Territory.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly met with these birds in the month of February. He found
them very abundant all along the banks of the Bill Williams Fork. They
were feeding on the young buds of the cottonwood trees. At that season
they were in small flocks, and the only note he heard from them was a short
chirp, as they hopped from twig to twig, or flew from one tree to another.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann states that he found these Finches abundant in the northern
mining regions of California, frequenting and feeding in the same localities
with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. lawrencii</i>, and often associated with the Pine Finch. He adds
that, while thus associated, he shot a large number of both species. They
seemed to be employed, at the time, in picking out the fine gravel mixed in
the mud used as mortar for a chimney, flying away at each discharge of the
gun, but returning, in a few minutes, to the same place.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon regarded this species as accidental in Louisiana, having
procured individuals a few miles from Bayou Sara.</p>

<p>The Arkansas Goldfinch was found by Mr. Ridgway among the Wahsatch
Mountains, his attention being at once drawn to it by its curious notes. He
first met with it in “City-Creek Cañon,” near Salt Lake City, where individuals
of it were frequently found mixed in with flocks of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. pinus</i>. The
note of this bird is remarkable for its power and very sad tone. The ordinary
note is a plaintive, mellow, whistling call, impossible to describe, and
so inflected as to produce a very mournful effect. When the bird takes to
flight, it is changed to a simple <i class="birdcall">cheer</i>, similar to the anxious notes of the male
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agelaius phœniceus</i>, uttered when its nest is disturbed. This species was
quite rare, not being so common as either <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. pinus</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. tristis</i>. Its nest
was found in Parley’s Park, Wahsatch Mountains, June 22, in the top of a
willow-bush near a stream.</p>

<p>At San Diego, and along the whole coast border of California, Dr. Cooper
thinks that this Finch is rather rare. In the interior valleys they seem to
be quite common. They also breed in small numbers in the Coast Range,
<!--547.png--><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 476]</span>
near Santa Cruz. He states that their habits are very similar to those of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. tristis</i>, though they feed more on the ground, and more upon weeds than
on trees, and are even more gregarious, remaining associated in flocks up to
the first of June. Their song greatly resembles that of the common Goldfinch,
but is much fainter.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper never met with their nest, nor has he received any description
of it. Mr. Xantus found one, containing four eggs, on the branch of an
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Obione</i>, about ten feet from the ground. This was at Fort Tejon, the first of
May. Dr. Canfield has also found their nests, in considerable numbers, near
Monterey. They are built in the forks of trees, in the same manner with
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tristis</i>, are structures of remarkable beauty, and evince great skill in the
architects. They contain usually four or five eggs. Except in size, their
eggs greatly resemble those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. tristis</i>, being of a uniform greenish-white,
unspotted, of a rounded-oval shape, sharply pointed at one end. They
measure .60 by .50 of an inch.</p>

<p>The specimen described above is from a series collected in Arizona by Dr.
Coues: these examples vary in the relative amount of black and olive on
the back, some having one, and others the other color predominating; the
type selected is one which represents about the average plumage of this
species from Arizona.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Dr. Coues found these birds abundant summer residents of Arizona,
where they are said to arrive the last of April and to remain until the
middle of September. In August the males are stated to assume the dull
plumage of the females. In autumn they become decidedly gregarious, and
feed almost exclusively upon buds and seeds. He thinks they are not so
numerous in the southern portions of the Territory. In a letter received
from him he remarks:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“This bird was found to be common in New Mexico near Fort Wingate,
at the eastern base of the main chain of mountains. I first observed it on the
28th of June, when I found quite a number together, and secured several
<!--548.png--><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 477]</span>
specimens. They were in small troops on a rugged hillside covered with a
sparse growth of junipers and stunted pines, feeding in company with the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poospiza bilineata</i>. Judging from their actions, and from the fact that none
but males were taken, I presume they were breeding in the vicinity. I found
some difficulty in securing specimens, partly owing to the broken nature of
the locality, and partly to the birds’ timidity in the unaccustomed presence
of man. Those that were shot were all found to have the æsophagus as well
as the gizzard crammed with seeds. They constantly uttered a plaintive
lisping whistle as they gathered food, or as they flew from one tree to another,
but their song did not strike my ear as precisely the same as that of the
Goldfinch. These specimens were all in what I take to be perfect plumage,
although the back was mixed with olive and black in nearly equal proportions,
and the black of the pileum did not reach below the eyes to cut off
the yellow under eyelid from the other yellowish parts of the head; thus
closely resembling true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">psaltria</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Upon my arrival at Fort Whipple in July, I found birds of this type
abundant, and took a good many during the two following months, when
they disappeared, and I saw none until about the first of May. A small
ravine close by the fort, choked with a rank growth of weeds, was a favorite
resort; there the birds could be found at nearly all times in season, in large
troops, feeding in company with Chipping Sparrows, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spizella atrigularis</i>.
They were very tame during the latter part of the summer, would
only rise when very closely approached, when they flew in a hesitating manner
a short distance, and then pitched down again among the weeds to
resume their busy search for food. In their undulating flight they utter
their peculiar note, generally with each impulse of the wings, and keep up
a continual chirping when feeding; but I did not hear their true song at this
season. Some of the specimens taken were very young birds, and the species
unquestionably breeds here, although I never succeeded in finding a
nest.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I should not omit to add, that whilst at Santa Fé, New Mexico, I saw
caged birds that were thriving well, and apparently reconciled to confinement.”</p>

<p>A nest of this bird, obtained near Camp Grant, Arizona, by Dr. Palmer, is
a flat and shallow structure, having a diameter of three inches, and a height
of one and a quarter. The cavity is only a slight depression. This nest is
made of a felting of various materials, chiefly the cotton-like down of the
cottonwood-tree and other soft vegetable matter, fine stems of grasses, fragments
of mosses, and various other similar materials, lined with finer materials
of the same. Except in their slightly smaller size, the eggs are not
distinguishably different from the preceding.</p>

<span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species, now known to be so common throughout the greater
portion of California, was first described by Mr. Cassin in 1850. Dr. Heermann
afterwards found them very abundant throughout the northern mining
regions of California, frequenting the hillsides covered with brush, the seeds
and buds of which they eat with great avidity. Later in the season he found
them at San Diego, in quest of grass-seeds on the level plains. They were
in large flocks, and so closely packed that he shot thirteen at one discharge.
Their nests, he states, are built in the fork of a bush or stunted oak, and are
composed of fine grasses, lined with hair and feathers. They contain four or
five pure white eggs.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway only met with this Goldfinch near the foot of the western
slope of the Sierra Nevada.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper met with a few of this species at Fort Mohave, on the Colorado,
but found them more numerous near the coast as far north as San Francisco,
at least, and also in the more northern mining regions. He has seen them
about San Francisco in December, and has no doubt that they remain all the
winter throughout the lower country. They seem to avoid the mountainous
regions, and have not been met with in Oregon.</p>

<p>Their habits and their song are, in general respects, similar to those of the
Goldfinch (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. tristis</i>), but their voice is much weaker, and is higher in its
pitch. Their nests, Dr. Cooper thinks, are placed, in preference, on the live-oaks;
at least, he has never met with them in any other situation. They are
built very much in the style of those of the Goldfinch, but are much smaller,
the cavity measuring only an inch in depth and one and a half in breadth.
The eggs he describes as four or five in number, pure white, and measuring
.80 by .46 of an inch. He adds that they sometimes feed on the ground, on
grass-seeds, as well as on buds and seeds of various weeds and trees. They
were regarded by him as more of a sylvan species than the Goldfinch, and
not so fond of willows and other trees growing along streams and in wet
places. In the Colorado Valley they feed on the seeds of the artemisia. He
did not notice any there after the middle of April. Eggs, in my own cabinet,
from Monterey, identified by Dr. Canfield, are of a uniform greenish-white,
exactly similar to those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. psaltria</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tristis</i>, and measure only
.58 by .45 of an inch, or less in length by .22 than as given by Dr. Cooper.</p>

<p>Three nests of this species obtained at Monterey, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, by Dr. Canfield, all
exhibit more or less variations as to material and style of make. They are
all more or less felted, and beautifully wrought, fully equal in artistic skill to
the nests of the Goldfinch. They are about one and a half inches in height
and three in diameter, and the cavity is an inch in depth and one and three
quarters in diameter. The walls of these nests are soft, warm, and thick,
composed of wool, both vegetable and animal, fine stems of grasses, down,
feathers, and other materials, all closely matted together, and lined with
the long hair of the larger animals. One of these nests is made up entirely
of the finer grasses, strongly matted together.</p>

the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carpodaci</i>. It is found throughout the United States, from the Atlantic
to the Pacific. In the winter it extends its irregular migrations into the Central
States, as far as Northern California on the Pacific, and Southern Pennsylvania
on the Atlantic. It breeds throughout the British Provinces,
Northern Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Michigan, and
thence to Washington Territory, in all the evergreen forests.</p>

<p>At Calais, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>, it is resident throughout the year, and breeds there, but is
much more common in the winter than in the summer. In Western Maine,
Professor Verrill observed it very common, both in the spring and in the
fall, but never found it breeding. He found it very abundant about the
Umbagog lakes in July, where it was evidently breeding. It breeds also
abundantly among the White Mountains.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway first saw the Pine Finch on the East Humboldt Mountains,
<!--552.png--><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 481]</span>
where, through July and August, it was quite common, and where undoubtedly
it breeds, as a young bird unable to fly was obtained. On the Wahsatch
Mountains it was a very abundant species, inhabiting the pines as well as the
groves of aspens in the alpine regions. <a id="chg13" name="chg13"></a>It is gregarious at all times, flying
in roving, screeching flocks. The notes it utters on all occasions resemble
a very peculiar pronunciation of <i class="birdcall">swe-er</i>, given in a very sharp tone. When
the flock suddenly takes to flight, this is changed to a more rattling outcry.
A nest, containing no eggs, was found in an aspen-tree; and another, containing
one egg, similar to those described elsewhere, was found in a fir-tree
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abies</i>) situated near the extremity of a horizontal branch about twenty feet
from the ground.</p>

<p>The Pine Finch is also a very common and resident bird in the plateau
of Mexico and in the alpine regions of the State of Vera Cruz. Its common
name there is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dominiguito montero</i>. In the alpine regions Sumichrast states
that it is found to the height of six thousand five hundred feet, and does not,
to his knowledge, descend below three thousand feet. It most especially
frequents the plateau.</p>

<p>Captain Blakiston met with this species on the plains of the Saskatchewan,
near the Rocky Mountains, August 6, 1858.</p>

<p>In the eastern portion of Massachusetts it is somewhat irregular in its
movements and appearance, which are supposed to be affected by the abundance
or scarcity of its food elsewhere. Here it feeds chiefly on seeds of
grasses and weeds, probably only after the seeds of the hemlock and other
forest trees have failed it. They are usually most abundant late in the
season and after heavy falls of snow farther north have diminished their
means of subsistence. Mr. Maynard found it very numerous in the winter
of 1859-60, remaining until quite late in the season, and again in the winter
of 1868-69, remaining until the last week in May. In Western Massachusetts,
according to Mr. Allen, it is a regular winter visitant, but never
abundant. It arrives early in October, and may be seen in small flocks from
that time to the third week in May. It sometimes frequents the apple-orchards,
where it feeds on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aphides</i>. According to Dr. Coues, this species
occasionally strays as far to the south as the Carolinas, but it is not
common there.</p>

<p>Wilson observed these birds near Philadelphia, where they were feeding on
the seeds of the alder. Later in the season they collected in larger flocks
and took up their abode among the pine woods. In one particular locality,
he states, a flock of two or three hundred of these birds regularly wintered, for
many years in succession, where noble avenues of pines furnished them with
abundant food throughout the season. Early in March they all disappeared.
While there, they were so tame as to allow a person to approach within a
few yards. They fluttered among the branches, frequently hanging from the
cones, at the same time uttering notes closely resembling those of the Goldfinch.</p>

<p><!--553.png--><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 482]</span>
In severe winters Mr. Audubon has met with the Pine Finch as far south
as Henderson, <abbr title="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr>, and Charleston, <abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>, but such visits were always brief.
In August, 1832, he met with flocks of these birds in Labrador. They were
in company with the Crossbill, and were feeding on the seeds of the fir-trees,
and also on those of the thistle. When at the Magdalen Islands he frequently
saw flocks moving from various directions. At Bras d’Or, towards the end of
July, they were in great numbers, and the old birds were accompanied by
their young. They frequented thickets of willows and elders in the vicinity
of water, and were very fearless and gentle. According to his account they
sing while on the wing, and their notes are sweet, varied, clear, and mellow,
and, while somewhat resembling the song of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. tristis</i>, are perfectly distinct
from it. Its flight is exactly similar, both gliding through the air in
graceful and deep curves.</p>

<p>In Washington Territory Dr. Cooper found this Finch an abundant and
constant resident, migrating to the coast in winter, where it feeds on the seeds
of the alder. In summer they were gregarious, even when occupied with
their nests and young. He has never met with any in California, not even
in the Sierra Nevada, though they have been found by others along its
whole western slope, as far south as Fort Tejon. They feed on the seeds
of both coniferous and deciduous trees.</p>

<p>Early in May, 1859, a pair of these birds built their nest in the garden of
Professor Benjamin Peirce, in Cambridge, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, near the colleges. It was
found on the 9th by Mr. Frederick Ware, and already contained its full
complement of four eggs, partly incubated. This nest was three inches
in height and four in diameter. The depth of the cavity, as well as its
diameter at the rim, was two inches. The base of this nest was a mass
of loose materials, and the lower portions of the sides were hardly different.
The upper and the inner portions of this fabric were much more compactly
and neatly woven, or rather felted together. The outer layers consisted
of small twigs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thuja</i>, dried stems and ends of pine twigs,
grasses, sedges, stalks of small vegetables, fine roots, bits of wool, and coarse
hair. The whole was very closely lined with fine dry roots of herbaceous
plants and the hair of small quadrupeds.</p>

<p>The eggs are of an oblong-oval shape, of a light green ground-color, spotted,
chiefly at the larger end, with markings of a light rusty-brown. They measure
.71 by .50 of an inch. They have a marked resemblance to the eggs of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Linariæ</i>, but the ground-color is of a slightly lighter shade.</p>

<p>A nest of this species, found May 15, 1868, at Brunich, Canada, was composed
almost entirely of pine twigs interlaced in a very neat and artistic
manner. Its diameter was three and a half inches, and its height two inches.
It was lined with hair. The cavity was one and a half inches deep and two
inches wide.</p>

<p>There are considerable differences

bill, in specimens from various parts
of North America, and to a less degree from the same locality. While
those of the Atlantic and Pacific coast have bills of much the same size, in

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. himalayana</i>, which is smaller even than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">americana</i>.</p>

In the intensity, as well as the shade of the red in the males, there is a
great range of variation. Generally it is of a tint almost precisely like
that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. curvirostra</i>, though deeper. The most highly colored specimen
is 54,795, Philadelphia (J. H. McIlvaine), which is entirely continuous deep
tile-red, approaching vermilion on the rump. The abdomen and crissum
are light pinkish. In <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 31,459, Fort Rae, April, the red is of a curious
and very unusual purplish wine-red shade.</p>

<p>The average of western specimens, particularly those from the northwest
coast of the United States, have bills scarcely larger than in the average of
eastern examples; thus, 18,037, Fort Crook, <abbr title="Northern California">N. Cal.</abbr>, has the bill of the same
size as <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 5,803, Philadelphia, while <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 53,482, East Humboldt Mountains,
has the bill smaller than any other in the collection.</p>

<p>In color, there are scarcely any tangible differences between the European
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Loxia curvirostra</i> and the two American varieties, the distinctive character
being in the form of the bill and the size; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. mexicana</i> is the largest of
the three, and the bill is quite peculiar in form, the lower mandible almost
equalling the upper in length, and exceeding it in thickness. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. curvirostra</i>
is slightly smaller, and has the lower mandible much smaller and less, powerful
than the upper, being inferior to it both in length, breadth, and thickness.
The colors also appear to be rather less intense than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. mexicana.</i></p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. americana</i> is in every way, the bill especially, smaller than either
of the preceding. The lower mandible, although but slightly shorter than
the upper, is still much weaker, as in the European bird. The majority of
western birds have the bill but slightly larger than eastern, and most of
those with large bills are only intermediate between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">americana</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mexicana.</i>
In some specimens the bill, although almost equalling in length
that of the latter, has yet the form of the former; on the other hand, there
are specimens with the proportions of the mandibles as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mexicana</i>, while
the size is intermediate.</p>

<p>The following figures will illustrate the differences in the size of the bills

<p>Specimens from the Columbia River region and northwest coast of the
United States appear to have the red more rosaceous and the bill more
slender than the typical style. One specimen (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 31,459, Fort Rae) is altogether
a very peculiar one; the shade of red is different from that of any
other specimen, being a dark maroon-carmine, with a clear ash suffusion on
the back. There are two distinct dusky stripes on the cheek, one over the
<!--559.png--><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 486]</span>
upper edge of the ear-coverts, the other along the lower edge. The lining
of the wing is without any red tinge, seen in all specimens of the true
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">americana</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mexicana</i>; the wings and tail are pure sepia-brown, quite different
from the others; and the feathers show no red margins. The lower
mandible is very much curved. (May not this be like some Siberian style?)</p>

<p>No 21,868, from Washington Territory, has the bill nearly as slender as in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. leucoptera</i>, but there is nothing else peculiar.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Red Crossbill of America is a bird of very irregular
distribution, abundant in some places at certain seasons, and again rarely
seen for several years. It is a Northern species, found in summer chiefly
in the more northern portions of the United States, and also found throughout
the year in the Alleghanies, in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, to
Georgia. A closely allied variety is also found in the alpine regions of Vera
Cruz and other departments of Mexico.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley found this species quite abundant at Puget Sound, in certain
seasons. This was especially so in the spring of 1854, though afterwards he
met with but few. He noticed a pair on the ground near a pool of rain-water.
They were very tame, and allowed a near approach. Dr. Cooper found it very
abundant near the coast, where it feeds, in winter, on the seeds of the black
spruce, retiring in summer to the mountains to breed, but returning in September.
He never observed any in the fir forests of the Coast Range. In
the Sierra Nevada, latitude 39<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, Dr. Cooper found these birds in considerable
numbers, September, 1863, and in winter they have been obtained about San
Francisco. They seem to be most attracted to the forests of spruces, cypresses,
and red-woods, the cones of which are most readily broken. They occasionally
descend to the ground, in the Rocky Mountains, in search of the seeds
of small plants, and also for water.</p>

<p>Mr. Bischoff obtained specimens of this species at Sitka, but it was not
noticed in the territory of the Yukon River by Mr. Dall, or any of his party,
and it was met with by Mr. Ridgway on the East Humboldt Mountains only.
There they were occasionally seen among the willows and small aspens bordering
the streams. Their common note was a fine and frequently repeated
<i class="birdcall">chick-chick-chick</i>, very different from the plaintive notes of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. leucoptera.</i></p>

<p>In New England they are of somewhat irregular occurrence, though in
Maine and in the northern portions of Vermont and New Hampshire they
are more or less resident. In Eastern Massachusetts they are comparatively
rare, excepting that, at irregular intervals, they come in large flocks during
the winter. This was so to a remarkable degree in the winter of 1832, and
more recently in 1862, when, Mr. Maynard states, they remained until April.
They were then in their summer plumage, and also in full song. In August
1868, they again became quite numerous, and had just before appeared in
large numbers in Western Maine, doing great damage to the oats, and disappearing
as soon as these had been harvested. Mr. Maynard thinks that these
birds were the same with those afterwards so numerous in Massachusetts.</p>

<p><!--560.png--><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 487]</span>
The same peculiarities of irregular appearance have been observed by Mr.
Allen, in Springfield, where it is often a very abundant visitor, but generally
not so common. In the winter of 1859-60 the pine woods in the
vicinity of that city abounded with them, and in February they were already
in full song. They are at all times gregarious, and are sometimes seen in
large flocks.</p>

<p>They have, as they fly, a loud, peculiar, and not unmusical cry. This call-note
they do not utter when at rest or when feeding. Their song in the spring
and summer is varied and pleasing, but is not powerful, or in any respect
remarkable. This song is especially noticeable in caged birds, who soon become
very tame, and feed readily from the hand, even when taken at an
adult age. Their manners in confinement are very like those of the Parrots,
clinging to the top of the wires with their claws, hanging with their heads
downward, and, when feeding, holding their food in one claw. On the trees,
their habits and manner are also said to be similar to those of Parrots.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon has found these birds, in August, in the pine woods of Pennsylvania,
and inferred that they breed there. This does not necessarily follow.
They breed so early at the north as to give ample time for their
migrations, even in midsummer, to remote places. Professor Baird, however,
informs me that during a summer spent in the mountains of Schuylkill
County, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>, in the coal region, he saw them nearly every day, moving
about or feeding, in pairs.</p>

<p>The Crossbills are extremely gentle and social, are easily approached,
caught in traps, and even knocked down with sticks. Their food is chiefly
the seeds of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coniferæ</i>, and also those of plants. Audubon’s statement that
they destroy apples merely to secure the seeds is hardly accurate. They
are extravagantly fond of this fruit, and prefer the flesh to its seeds. Their
flight is undulating, somewhat in the manner of the Goldfinch, firm, swift,
and often protracted. As they fly, they always keep up the utterance of
their loud, clear call-notes. They move readily on the ground, up or down
the trunks and limbs of trees, and stand as readily with their heads downward
as upright.</p>

<p>Wilson states that in the interior of Pennsylvania this species appears in
large flocks in the winter, and during the prevalence of deep snows they
keep about the doors of dwellings, pick off the clay with which these huts
are plastered, and are exceedingly tame and not easily driven off.</p>

<p>So far as is known, these Crossbills breed in midwinter, or very early in
the spring, when the weather is the most inclement. The nest and eggs
of this species were procured by Mr. Charles S. Paine, in East Randolph, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>,
early in the month of March. The nest was built in an upper branch of an
elm,&mdash;which, of course, was leafless,&mdash;the ground was covered with snow,
and the weather severe. The birds were very tame and fearless, refusing to
leave their eggs, and had to be several times taken off by the hand. After
its nest had been taken, and as Mr. Paine was descending with it in his hand,
<!--561.png--><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 488]</span>
the female again resumed her place upon it, to protect her eggs from the
biting frost. The eggs were four in number, and measured .85 by .53 of
an inch. They have a greenish-white ground and are beautifully blotched,
marbled, and dotted with various shades of lilac and purplish-brown.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Mountainous regions of Southern North America, from Guatemala, north into

<p>This bird is quite as well marked as any of the plain-winged “species,”
differing from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curvirostra</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">americana</i> quite as much as they do from each
other.</p>

<p>All specimens from Mexico, as well as from the Central Rocky Mountains
of the United States, are referrible to this form, though in winter the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">americana</i>
may also be found in the latter region, as a migrant from the north.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The occurrence of this well-marked race among the mountainous
districts of Mexico is a very interesting and suggestive fact in regard to
the distribution of birds, demonstrating, as it does, the close connection between
high latitudes and high elevations as favoring similar forms. It was
first described by Strickland from specimens obtained on the plateau near
the city of Mexico. Another specimen is referred to by Mr. Sclater as
having been received from Jalapa, Mexico; and Mr. Sumichrast obtained
also a single specimen of this species at Moyoapam, in the alpine region of
Orizaba, where it is known as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pico cruzado</i>. It was taken at an elevation
of about 7,500 feet. Mr. Sumichrast was unable to determine whether
this bird was resident, or only a migratory visitant in the winter. I can find
no reference to any distinctive peculiarities of habits.</p>

brownish, tinged with olive-green in places; feathers of the back and crown with dusky

<p>The white bands on the wings distinguish this species from the preceding,
although there are some other differences in form of bill, feet,
wing, etc. There is less variation in form and color among specimens than
in the preceding. It differs from the European analogue, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. bifasciata</i>, according
to authors, in the more slender body and bill, and in having the
body pomegranate-red, with blackish back, instead of cinnabar-red, as in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curvirostra</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">americana</i>, Bonaparte and Schlegel quote the American
species as occurring in the Himalaya Mountains, and perhaps Japan, but
throw doubts on the supposed European localities.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Both the distribution and habits of this species are probably, in
all essential respects, the same with those of the preceding. It is, if anything,
a more northern bird, and it has not been detected anywhere on the
Pacific coast south of British America. It was found in the Arctic regions
by Sir John Richardson, where the other species was not observed. He
found it inhabiting the dense white-spruce forests of the fur country, feeding
principally on the seeds of their cones. Up to the sixty-eighth parallel he
found them ranging through the whole breadth of the continent. It is supposed
to go as far as these woods extend, though it has not been traced farther
than the sixty-second degree. It was found feeding on the upper
branches, clinging to them when wounded, and remaining suspended even
after death. In September they collected in small flocks, and flew from tree
to tree with a chattering noise. In the depth of winter they retire from the
coast to the thick woods of the interior.</p>

<p>A few individuals of this species are recorded by Professor Reinhardt as
having been taken in South Greenland.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania this species is much more rare than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">americana</i>, and
Wilson only met with a few specimens. Since his day it has been found
more abundantly, occasionally in the neighborhood of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Mr. Dall states that these birds were not uncommon near Nulato in the
winter. Several specimens were obtained in February and April. None
were found there in the summer. He speaks of their great expertness in
opening the spruce cones with their curved bills, and extracting the seeds.</p>

<p>Its appearance in Eastern Massachusetts is much more irregular both as to
numbers and time than that of the other species. In the fall and winter of
1868 and 1869 they were uncommonly abundant, appearing early in the fall,
and remaining until quite late in the spring. They were even more fearless
<!--563.png--><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 490]</span>
and tame than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">americana</i>, and in one instance a pair were taken by the
hand, and afterwards kept in confinement. They appeared around Boston in
large flocks, and remained through April. One was shot in Newton by Mr.
Maynard, June 13. It was found in an apple-tree, and its crop was full of
canker-worms. In Eastern Maine it is resident throughout the year, and,
like the other species, breeds in winter. In Western Maine Professor Verrill
has found it a common winter visitant, but it is not known to be resident.</p>

<p>Near Springfield Mr. Allen considered this species a much less frequent
visitor than the preceding. In the winters of 1854 and 1860 he found them
very abundant, occurring in large flocks.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon, on his way to Labrador in 1833, found these birds quite
common, in May, among the islands of the Bay of Fundy, evidently migrating,
on their way to more northern regions. I, however, observed none there
during my visits in the summers of 1850 and 1851, although a specimen was
afterwards obtained on the Murre Islands, on the 30th of June.</p>

<p>So far as they are known, the habits of this species are exactly similar to
those of the preceding. They feed in the same manner and upon like food.
Their flight is undulating and well sustained, and their movements in the
trees are not perceptibly different.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1869, Mr. Jillson, of Hudson, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, sent me a pair of
these birds which he had captured the preceding autumn. They were very
tame, and were exceedingly interesting little pets. Their movements in the
cage were like those of caged parrots in every respect, except that they
were far more easy and rapid. They clung to the sides and upper wires of
the cage with their feet, hung down from them, and seemed to enjoy the
practice of walking with their head downward. They were in full song, and
both the male and the female were quite good singers. Their songs were
irregular and varied, but sweet and musical. They ate almost every kind of
food, but were especially eager for slices of raw apples. An occasional larch
cone was also a great treat to them. Although while they lived they were
continually bickering over their food, yet when the female was accidentally
choked by a bit of eggshell her mate was inconsolable, ceased to sing, refused
his food, and died of grief in a very few days.</p>

<p>The White-winged Crossbill was seen more frequently by Mr. Ridgway
among the East Humboldt Mountains than the other species. It was first
noticed on the 12th of August among the cedars on the mountains. Its fine
plaintive cry of “<i class="birdcall">wēēk</i>” was entirely different from the hurriedly uttered
notes of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. americana</i>.</p>

<p>Several specimens of this Crossbill have been taken in Europe, where
their occurrence is of course accidental, irregular, and rare.</p>

<p>A nest of this species (<abbr title="Smithsonian Institution">S. I.</abbr>, 13,452), taken at Fredericton, New Brunswick,
by Dr. A. Adams, in 1868, is deeply saucer-shaped, and composed of a rather
thin wall of fibrous pale-green lichens, encased on the outside with spruce
<!--564.png--><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 491]</span>
twigs, and thinly lined with coarse hairs and fine shreds of inner bark.
Its external diameter is a little less than four inches, the rim being almost
perfectly circular; the cavity is an inch and a half deep by two and a half
broad.</p>

<p>The one egg is pale blue, the large end rather thickly spattered with fine
dots of black and ashy-lilac; is regularly or rather slightly elongate-oval,
the small end rather obtuse. It measures .80 of an inch in length by .56 in
breadth.</p>

<p>Difficult as it sometimes is to define with precision the characters of closely
allied species of birds, there are few genera where this is the case more
strikingly than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ægiothus</i>. Leaving out of view the peculiar European
species, it has been a mooted question whether North America, including
Greenland, possesses one, two, or six species, owing to the strictly boreal
distribution of these birds, and the fact
that their summer resorts are seldom invaded
by the naturalist. The necessary
means of determining the proper distribution
of the forms and the variations
with season, locality, and sex, are scarcely
to be met with in any public museum,
that of the Smithsonian Institution,
however, being the most complete in
this respect.</p>

<p>To Dr. Coues, as quoted above, we owe
the most satisfactory indications of the different species and varieties, his
papers in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences
<!--565.png--><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 492]</span>
(1861, 375; 1863, 40; and 1869, 180) being models of ornithological criticism
and discussion. His labors have enabled us to define with precision the
various forms, both European and American, found in the genus, and have
brought us to satisfactory conclusions in reference to their limitations.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway has lately made a careful revision of the specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ægiothus</i>
in the Smithsonian collection, and with a general concurrence in the
conclusions of Dr. Coues in regard to the differences observable, he suggests,
as an application of the laws more recently verified by him and myself
in our examination of the North American land-birds, that we may best consider
the actual species to be two in number, namely, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">canescens</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linarius</i>,
ranging the other forms under these, either as geographical races or as seasonal
stages. Bearing in mind the general law that the more boreal or
Greenland-born specimens should be larger than the more southern or Continental,
and that the peculiar dark plumage of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscescens</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rostratus</i>
only occurs in summer breeding specimens, he considers these as identical
with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linarius</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">holbölli</i>; the winter plumages respectively of the same two
races of one species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linarius</i>; the latter race, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">holbölli</i>, being the larger or
Greenland form. If <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscescens</i> be darker than summer <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linarius</i> from Europe,
it is simply another instance of the darker tints of Arctic American
birds as compared with European.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ægiothus canescens</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exilipes</i> Mr. Ridgway considers as the Greenland
(larger) and Continental (smaller) races of one species, which perhaps do not
differ so much with season as do those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linarius</i>. The differences in the
size and proportions of bill, and perhaps of feet, Mr. Ridgway does not think
of much importance, as great variations are observable in this respect in
specimens from the same locality, and the actual differences of the bill are
obscured by the greater length of the bristly feathers around its base in
winter, making it appear considerably shorter. Indeed, Professor Alfred
Newton maintains that the same bird will have the bill considerably longer
in summer, after living on soft insect food, and shorter in winter when worn
down by use on hard seeds. Mr. Ridgway finds, too, that specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linarius</i>
from Kodiak differ in a much longer and more slender bill than usual,
in this respect resembling Alaska specimens of several other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fringillidæ</i>.</p>

<p>The following synopsis expresses Mr. Ridgway’s views as indicated above:
a critical examination of a series of more than two hundred specimens, in
the collection of the Smithsonian Institution, being the basis of his conclusions.&mdash;S. F. B.</p>

<p>The two races of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æ. linarius</i> are quite differently colored in summer and
in winter. In the latter season the plumage is softer and more lax, and the
markings better defined, though in autumn with a considerable ochraceous
suffusion. In spring the colors are purer, and the markings most sharply
<!--568.png--><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 495]</span>
defined; in the breeding-season the plumage assumes a burnt appearance,
the dark tints intensify and spread, so that sometimes the upper parts appear
almost uniformly dusky; the bill appears larger, in consequence of the less
development of its basal tufts, than in winter. In this dusky summer condition
these birds form the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æ. fuscescens</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æ. rostratus</i> of Coues, the latter
being the summer plumage of <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">holbölli</i>, the former that of <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linarius</i>.
In the series of over two hundred examples examined, all midsummer specimens
are in the plumage of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscescens</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rostratus</i>, while the latter is not
seen in any autumnal, winter, or spring birds.</p>

<p>Specimens of the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">holbölli</i> have been received from Quebec, collected
by Mr. W. Couper.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Accepting as variations due either to locality, latitude, or season
the differences already referred to in the plumage of this species, it is not
necessary to consider the question of races in connection with our story of
their habits. We possess but very little information as to their peculiarities
as races in these respects. Treating, then, the Lesser Red-Poll, though appearing
in four differing phases, as one species, we claim it to be common to
the northern portions of both hemispheres.</p>

<p>It is found throughout northern North America from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, is abundant in the boreal regions of Europe, and probably of Asia
also. On the Pacific coast, Dr. Cooper has observed it only as far south as
Washington Territory. Farther north it is much more abundant. Mr. Bannister
found it common at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michaels, both in summer and in winter. At
Nulato Mr. Dall found this species very common in winter, and very little
less so in summer. He states that the nest is usually lined with hair, and
covered externally with moss, dry grass, and like materials, built in bushes,
near the ground. They begin to build the 15th of May. The eggs are laid
about the 1st of June, and the young are flying near the end of July.
The young of the first year are dark, with a small patch of brown on the
breast. After their second year the males increase the amount of rose-color
on the head and breast, and the very old birds are quite brilliant in the
breeding-season. At <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michaels, where there are no trees and very few
bushes; these birds frequently build their nests in the grass.</p>

<p>Mr. Dall states that this bird has no song, but that their cheerful twittering
and chirping, their fearless and sociable ways, their bright plumage and
elegant nests, are quite enough to make them general favorites.</p>

<p>Richardson found this neat and hardy little bird one of the few permanent
residents of the fur countries, where it was seen, in the coldest weather, on the
banks of lakes and rivers, hopping among the reeds or clinging to their stalks.</p>

<p>Mr. Lord found this species a rare bird in British Columbia. It was found
in swampy places, where the alders grew thickly, and where there were large
water-plants. To these it clings, pecking at their seed-pods, or, searching the
remaining flowers, feeds upon any insects they may contain. Their song he
describes as a soft and pretty warble, coming in bursts, the singer perching
<!--569.png--><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 496]</span>
himself boldly on the top of a plant, as if to be more plainly heard by his
companions. In early spring they feed on the catkins of the alder and
hazel. They winter in small flocks in Vancouver’s Island.</p>

<p>Holböll states that this species is found irregularly distributed over Greenland,
coming always in the first half of April, a little later than the Snow-Bunting.
It migrates to Greenland from America, and is much rarer in Iceland.
In June it is found nesting near the shore, and, contrary to the usual
nature of birds, is very wild, though at all times else it is very fearless. At
this time the male loses its beautiful crimson breast, resembles the female,
and is much less gorgeous than in winter. It nests in birches, alders, or
willows, and lays five bluish-white eggs, spotted with clear brown. Towards
the end of August and in September they are seen in small flocks about the
settlements, the male resuming its red breast, and all, both old and young,
being very fearless. In confinement they soon became very tame, and in a
few days would perch upon his hand and struggle with each other for the
hemp-seed that he held to them, though there was plenty of food in their
cage. They feed on seeds and the tops of lichens. By October they all
disappear, and are not seen in Greenland in the winter.</p>

<p>Wilson states that, in his day, these birds were very common in Northwestern
New York, where they appeared always with the first deep snow,
and were, on that account, called Snow-Birds. In severe winters they were
occasionally, though very rarely, seen in the neighborhood of Philadelphia,
where they were very fond of the seeds of the common alder, and hung head
downwards while feeding, in the manner of our Goldfinch. They were very
unsuspicious, and permitted a near approach without manifesting any signs
of alarm. Mr. Ord, in a subsequent edition of Wilson, states that these
birds rarely visit Philadelphia, and that it was many years before he could
procure specimens. In the winter of 1813-14 they appeared in a flock of
nearly a hundred, and were so intent in feeding upon the seeds of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atriplex
hastata</i> that they could be closely approached. Their call exactly resembled
that of the Goldfinch. These birds lingered in that neighborhood
until about the middle of April.</p>

<p>Their migration southward in winter is evidently caused more by want of
food than by the state of the temperature. They remain in high northern
regions in the most inclement weather, and often appear among us in seasons
not remarkably cold, and remain until late in the spring. In 1833, by the
7th of November, the weather still being quite mild, Nuttall states, they appeared
in Massachusetts in considerable flocks. They regularly assembled in
the birch-trees every morning to feed on the seeds, and were so intent on
their employment that it was often possible to approach the slender trees on
which they were feeding, and strike them off, before they would take wing.
They hung on the twigs with great tenacity, and moved about in reversed
positions, in the manner of the Chickadees. They are described by him as
having a quailing call, similar to that of the Goldfinch, and when crowding
<!--570.png--><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 497]</span>
together, in flight, as making a confused chirping, with a rattling noise, and
moving off with a simultaneous twitter. They were attracted to the pines by
the Crossbills, and were busily employed in collecting the seeds, dropped from
the cones as the Crossbills opened them. They at times fed on the buds of
fruit-trees. They were always found to be fat, even on their first arrival,
and there were no obvious reasons for their movements.</p>

<p>Mr. Boardman speaks of them as common at Calais by the first of the
winter. At Norway, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>, Professor Verrill found them very common in fall,
winter, and spring, and most abundant in March and April. In Springfield
they are, according to Mr. Allen, an irregular and occasional visitant, coming
in very large flocks one year, and again not seen for several years. In a
more recent paper (1870) Mr. Allen states that during the preceding five years
these birds have been several times very numerous in Massachusetts, appearing
in quite large flocks.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon met with these birds in Labrador the last of July, and obtained
specimens of different ages. He thinks their notes more like those
of the Siskin of Europe than of our Goldfinch, uttered both when the birds
are on the wing and when they have alighted. They were in small parties of
seven or eight, evidently members of the same family. They were tame and
familiar, and fearlessly returned to the same spot after having been shot
at. They were also remarkably affectionate, and he frequently observed them
passing seeds one to the other in the most loving manner.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues also observed this bird in Labrador, and described it as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æ. fuscescens</i>.
He found it abundant along the coast, and was struck with its resemblance,
in habits, to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chrysomitris tristis</i>. It was remarkably unsuspicious
and familiar, and showed no signs of fear even when very closely
approached. It frequented, almost exclusively, the scrubby junipers that
grow everywhere in open places in thick impenetrable patches. He describes
its flight as irregular, rising and falling in curves, and seldom protracted to
any great distance. While passing overhead, it uttered a peculiar rattling
chirp. He thinks it has no song.</p>

<p>Dr. Kirtland informs me that early in the winter of 1868 his grandson
picked up a wing-broken male Red-Poll, and placed it in his greenhouse. It
began at once to feed on crumbs of bread and hay-seed, and rapidly recovered.
It soon acquired the habit of leaping from shelf to shelf, among the plants, and
was finally seen climbing up some stately <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pelargonium</i> shrubs, and suspending
itself, parrot-like, by its feet from the limbs, capturing aphides. From that
time it took no other food, living exclusively on the parasitic insects of the
plants. So active was it in capturing these, that for two months it was not
necessary to fumigate the greenhouse to destroy them. From day to day a
female Red-Poll hovered over the building, and her calls were responded to
by the invalid. Later in the season he escaped from his confinement, and
was seen to rejoin his faithful mate, which had remained near him all the
winter. As in Europe, this species in the Arctic regions of America has been
found nesting in low trees and bushes, from two to six feet from the ground.</p>

<p><!--571.png--><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 498]</span>
The habits and appearance of the birds observed in Europe appear identical
with those of our own. Mr. Yarrell states that of all birds these are the
most easily tamed, and can be readily made to breed in confinement. In
Scotland and in parts of England it is resident throughout the year, in the
summer retiring to the bases of the mountains, and there breeding in the underwood
that skirts the banks of the mountain streams. It nests in bushes
or low trees, such as the alder and the willow. These are constructed of
mosses and the stems of dry grasses, intermingled with down from the catkins
of the willow, and lined with the same, making them soft and warm. The
young are produced late in the season, and are seldom able to fly before the
first of July. The parent birds are devoted in their attachment. Pennant
relates that in one instance where this bird was sitting on four eggs, she was
so tenacious of her nest as to suffer him to take her off with his hand, and
after having been released she still refused to leave it. In the winter they
descend to the lower grounds, and there feed on the buds of the birch and
alder, to reach which they are obliged, like the Titmice, to hang from the
ends of the branches, with their backs downward. So intent are they on
their work that they are easily taken alive by means of a long stick smeared
with birdlime. Mr. Selby states that its notes during the breeding-season,
though not delivered in a continuous song, are sweet and pleasing. Captain
Scoresby relates that in his approach to Spitsbergen several of these birds
alighted on his ship. They were so wearied with their long journey as to be
easily caught by the hand. The distance of the nearest point of Norway
renders it difficult to imagine how so delicate a bird can perform this journey,
or why it should seek such a cold and barren country. European eggs are
five in number, of a pale bluish-green, spotted with orange-brown, principally
about the larger end. They measure .65 by .50 of an inch.</p>

<p>American eggs of this species average .65 by .53 of an inch. Their
color is a light bluish-white, which varies considerably in the depth of its
shading, and this tinge is exceedingly fugitive, it being difficult to preserve
it even in a cabinet. The eggs are generally and finely dotted with a rusty-brown,
and are of a rather rounded oval shape.</p>

<p>Though <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æ. canescens</i> is nearly identical with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æ. linarius</i> in size, these two
species may always be distinguished from each other by certain well-marked
and constant differences in coloration; the principal of these have been mentioned
in the synoptical table, but a few other points may be noted here. In
spring males of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">canescens</i> the delicate rosaceous-pink of the breast does not
extend up on to the cheeks, and backward it extends farther medially than
laterally, scarcely tingeing the sides at all; while in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æ. linarius</i> the intensely
rosaceous, almost carmine, tint covers the cheeks, and extends backward
much farther laterally than medially, covering nearly the whole sides.</p>

<p>Though the weakness, or shortness, of the toes compared with the tarsus,
is a feature distinguishing, upon almost microscopical comparison, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æ. canescens</i>
in its two races from the races of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æ. linarius</i>, it will not by any means
serve to distinguish <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">canescens</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exilipes</i>, since, as will be seen by the measurements
given, the proportion of the toes to the tarsus is a specific, and not
a race, character. (<span class="sc">Ridgway.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The history of the Mealy Red-Poll can only be presented with
some doubts and uncertainties. We cannot always determine how far the
accounts given by others may have belonged to this species, and we can only
accept, with some reserve, their statements.</p>

<p>This form, whether species or race, is known to inhabit Greenland, where,
according to Dr. Reinhardt, it is constantly resident, and I have received its
<!--573.png--><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 500]</span>
eggs from that country, where its identification was apparently complete.
Whether this bird is resident in, regularly migratory to, or only accidental
in, Europe, is as yet a question by no means fully settled. Degland gives
it as resident in Greenland only, and as accidental in Germany, Belgium,
and the north of France. He states that it is known to nest in shrubs
and in low trees, and that, in all essential respects, its manners are identical
with the common Red-Poll. One of these birds was taken alive in a snare
in the vicinity of Abbeville, and kept in a cage, making part of the collection
of M. Baillon.</p>

<p>Yarrell thought that sufficient evidence existed of its specific distinctness,
but Mr. Gould regarded it as a matter of doubt whether the birds found in
Europe were natives, or only arrivals from northern America. He states that
among the London dealers this bird, called by them the Stone Red-Poll, is
well known, and is considered distinct, but that its occurrence is very rare.
Occasionally, at great intervals, they are said to have been abundant.</p>

<p>Mr. Doubleday, of Epping, procured several specimens of this bird in Colchester,
in January, 1836, and afterwards obtained a living pair, which he
kept for some time. Their notes were much sharper than those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linarius</i>.
Its occurrence was most frequent in winter, many specimens having
been obtained in England, and some also in Scotland. Its habits throughout
the year are supposed to be very similar to those of the common Red-Poll.
Its food is said to be chiefly the seeds of various forest trees.</p>

<p>Mr. Temminck describes what is undoubtedly this species, under the title
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">borealis</i>. If this supposition be admitted to be correct, its geographical
distribution becomes much more clearly defined. He states that it is found
during the summer in Norway and Sweden, and is resident of the Arctic
Circle throughout the year, and is also found in Northern Asia, as well as in
America and in other parts of Europe. He has received specimens from
Greenland, and also from Japan, differing in no respect from those found in
Europe.</p>

<p>Audubon states that he procured four specimens of this bird in Newfoundland.
In their habits he could see no difference between them and the common
Red-Poll, but did observe a noticeable difference in their song. He
also states that one was shot by Mr. Edward Harris near Moorestown, <abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr></p>

<p>Mr. John Wolley, in his expeditions to Lapland, found there only one
species of this genus which was clearly referrible to the Mealy Red-Poll, and
was a common resident bird. One of these eggs from Lapland is larger,
and a much lighter-colored egg, than any of the common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linarius</i>. The
ground is a greenish-white, sparingly spotted with dark reddish-brown about
the larger end. Its measurement is .80 by .58 of an inch. An egg from
Greenland is not perceptibly different in size, color, or markings.</p>

<p>Holböll, in his papers on the fauna of Greenland, demonstrates very distinctly
the specific differences between this bird and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linarius</i>. These
are its stronger and broader bill, the difference in colors at every age, its
<!--574.png--><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 501]</span>
much greater size, its very different notes, and its quite different modes of
life, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">canescens</i> being a strictly resident species, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linarius</i> being
migratory.</p>

<p>In the summer this species is found to the extreme north of Greenland,
and has never been known to nest farther south than the 69th parallel. It
is more numerous in North Greenland than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linarius</i>, which is rare at the
extreme north, while this is very common even at latitude 73<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. This bird
builds its nests in bushes in the same manner with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linarius</i>, and its eggs
closely resemble those of that bird. Its notes, he adds, do not at all resemble
those of the Red-Poll, but are like those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ampelis garrulus</i>.</p>

<p>It is a resident of Greenland throughout the year, and in the winter keeps
on the mountains in the interior, but is much more numerous at latitude 66<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>
than farther south. In February, 1826, Holböll saw many flocks on the
mountains between Ritenbank and Omanak, and in the journey taken in
1830 by a merchant from Holsteinborg into the interior of the country a
great many flocks were observed. They are also frequently met with by
reindeer-hunters, who go far into the interior. It is rarely found in South
Greenland at any time, and never in the summer. In mild winters they
sometimes come about the settlements, as happened in the winter of 1828-29,
and again in 1837-38. In the intervening winters it was not seen at Godhaab,
and in severe winters it is never to be found near the coast, only single
specimens occurring there in spring and autumn.</p>

<p>Mr. MacFarlane thinks this species spends the winter at Fort Anderson, as
he has met with it as late as December and as early as February, and believes
it to have been present in the vicinity in the interval. It nests in May.
Mr. Harriott found one of its nests on the branch of a tree, about five feet
from the ground. It contained five eggs.</p>

<p>The egg of this species resembles that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linarius</i> except in size and its
lighter ground-color. The ground is a bluish or greenish white, dotted with
a tawny-brown. The egg is of a more oval shape, and measures .75 by .60
of an inch.</p>

<p>As the present article on <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ægiothus</i> is going to press, we have received,
through the kindness of Dr. Brewer, a specimen of what appears to be a
third species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ægiothus</i>, allied to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æ. flavirostris</i> of Europe, obtained
in Waltham, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, by Mr. William Brewster, of Cambridge. This bird
was killed in a flock of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æ. linarius</i>, of which five were also shot at the
same discharge. None of the others, nor indeed of any of ninety specimens
prepared by Mr. Brewster during the winter, were at all like the present one,
which is entirely different from anything we have ever seen from North
America.</p>

<p>The relationship of this bird appears to be nearest to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æ. flavirostris</i> of
Europe, with the <abbr title="female symbol">♀</abbr> of which it agrees in many respects, as distinguished
from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linarius</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">canescens</i>. The European bird, however, lacks the sulphur-yellow
tinge (which gives it somewhat the appearance of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chrysomitris
pinus</i>), has the throat and jugulum strongly reddish-buff, instead of dingy
yellowish-white, and is much browner above; besides which the tail is longer
and less deeply forked, with narrower feathers.</p>

<p>The number of American species, or at least races, of this genus has been
increased considerably since the publication of Birds of North America, five
now belonging to the American fauna, instead of the three there mentioned.
Of the species usually assigned to the genus, one, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. arctoa</i>, is quite different
in form, lacking the ridge of the mandible, etc., and in having the ends of the
secondaries graduated in the closed
wing, instead of being all on the same
line. The colors, too, are normally
different; in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arctoa</i> being dusky,
with silvery-gray wings and tail,
without rose tips to the feathers of
the posterior part of body; and in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leucosticte</i> proper, the wings and tail
being dark-brown narrowly edged
with whitish, or more broadly, like
the ends of the feathers of the body
behind, with rose-color. For the
present, however, we shall combine the species, not having before us any
American specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. arctoa</i>.</p>

<p>From the regular gradation of each form into the other&mdash;the extremes
being thus connected by an unbroken chain of intermediate forms&mdash;it seems
reasonable to consider all the North American forms as referable to one species
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. tephrocotis</i>, <abbr title="Swainson"><span class="sc">Sw.</span></abbr>, 1831) as geographical races. They may be distinguished

<p class="small"><i class="subset">Young.</i> Pattern of coloration as in the adult of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. tephrocotis</i>; ash similarly restricted,
but with the black frontal patch badly defined. The brown of the plumage, however, is
of an entirely different shade from that of adult specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tephrocotis</i>, being of a blackish-sepia
cast, much darker, even, than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">griseinucha</i>; each feather also broadly bordered
terminally with paler, these borders being whitish on the throat and breast, brownish on
the nape and back, and light rose (broadly) on the scapulars. The whole abdomen,
flanks, and crissum are nearly continuously peach-blossom pink, which, with that of the
lesser and middle wing-coverts and rump, is of a finer and brighter tint than in adults.
The other edgings to wings are pale ochraceous; under side of wing pure white. Bill dull
yellow, dusky toward tip. Wing, 4.20; tail, 3.80. (60,638, Uintah Mountains, Utah,
September 20, 1870; <span class="sc">Dr. F. V. Hayden</span>.)</p>

<p>The young specimen described was obtained during the summer of 1871
in the Uintah Mountains; and were it not unmistakably a bird of the year,
it would be considered almost a distinct species, so different is it from
adult specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tephrocotis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Of the history and habits of this well-marked and strikingly
peculiar bird, but little is known. It was first described by Swainson from
a single specimen, obtained on the Saskatchewan Plains, in May, by Dr.
Richardson’s party. Specimens were afterwards procured in Captain Stansbury’s
expedition, near Salt Lake City, Utah, in March, 1850. Dr. Hayden
found them very abundant on the Laramie Plains during the winter season,
and Mr. Pearsall obtained numbers about Fort Benton. Dr. Cooper has also
seen one specimen brought from somewhere east of Lake Tahoe, in Washoe,
by Mr. F. Gruber. They were said to be plentiful there in the cold winter
of 1861-62. Dr. Cooper thinks it probable that they visit the similar
country east of the northern Sierra Nevada, in California.</p>

<p>A single flock of what is presumed to have been this species was seen by
Mr. Ridgway, on the 5th of January, in the outskirts of Virginia City, Nevada.
<!--579.png--><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 506]</span>
The flock was flitting restlessly over the snow in the manner of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plectrophanes</i>.</p>

<p>Nothing has been ascertained, so far as we are now informed, as to its nest,
eggs, or general distribution during the breeding-season.</p>

<p>Mr. J. K. Lord states that he met with a flock of these rare and beautiful
birds on the summit of the Cascade Mountains. It was late in October, and
he observed a flock of nine or ten birds pecking along the ground, and feeding
somewhat in the manner of Larks. Puzzled to know what birds they
could be at such an altitude so late in the year, he fired among them and
secured three, a female and two males in fine plumage. (Perhaps <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">littoralis</i>.)</p>

<p>In July of the following summer, on the summit of the Rocky Mountains,
near the Kootanie Pass, he again saw these birds feeding on the ground. He
shot several, but they were all young birds of the year. It is therefore rendered
probable that these Finches breed on the Cascade and Rocky Mountains,
in both at about the same altitude, or seven thousand feet, coming
into the lowlands during the winter, as it is not likely that they could endure
the cold of the summits, or find there a sufficiency of food, the winter being
very severe, and the snow three feet, or more in depth.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles N. Holden, a promising young ornithologist of Chicago, who
observed these birds among the Black Hills, near Sherman, at an altitude
of eight thousand feet above the sea, has furnished me with interesting
observations in regard to them. He informs me that he did not meet with
these birds there in summer. They came in small flocks in the coldest part
of winter. Their food consisted of small seeds and insects. In some instances
he found the crops so distended with seeds as to distort their shape.
They become very fat, and are excellent eating. In one specimen, a young
male, the plumage was almost black, as described at the beginning of this
article. These birds were quite numerous, and nearly forty specimens were
secured. He was not able to learn anything in reference to their breeding-places.
Except by dissection, he found it difficult to distinguish between a
young male of the first year and a female.</p>

<p>If the specimen referred to in the foot-note at the beginning of this article
as collected by Mr. Allen on Mount Lincoln be really this species, an important
advance in its history will have been reached, showing that their
summers are spent in the high mountain summits, and that the rest of the
year is passed lower down on the plains.</p>

<p>This form bears a close resemblance to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. tephrocotis</i>, and may, indeed, be
a variety of it; but as it differs in the characters that appear generally to be
those most constant in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leucosticte</i>, and as, in fifty skins of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tephrocotis</i>
from one locality, we have seen nothing like it, we are inclined to consider
them distinct. The size and general appearance are much the same, the
difference being that in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tephrocotis</i> the whole cheeks are chocolate below the
level of the eye, the chin without any gray; while in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">campestris</i> the sides
of head below the eye, but not including the ears, with a narrow border of
the chin, are of this color.</p>

<p>From <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">littoralis</i> this form may be distinguished by the less extent of ash
on the cheeks, which in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">littoralis</i> covers the whole ears, and extends back
farther on the head all round. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. griseinucha</i> is marked like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">littoralis</i>, and
is much larger than either. Possibly it may be well to entertain the idea
of its being a hybrid between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tephrocotis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">littoralis</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">griseinucha</i>.</p>

<p>The specimen described was presented to the Smithsonian Institution by
Dr. Wernigk, and at the time was supposed to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. tephrocotis</i>.</p>

<p>Of this form, nothing as to its habits is known with certainty. It probably
does not differ in any important respect from the allied races.</p>

<p>This race, which we believe to be the Southern coast representative of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">griseinucha</i>,
bears much resemblance to that bird, but is considerably smaller; the
colors are brighter and lighter, more like those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tephrocotis</i>, and the bill is
shorter and more conical, the dark patch on the head more restricted, the chin
more ashy, and the brown of the head not so far forward. From <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tephrocotis</i>
it is distinguished by the extension of the ash of head below the eye; and from
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">campestris</i> by having the ear-coverts ashy, instead of the anterior portion of
the cheeks only; and there is apparently a greater extent of gray on the chin.</p>

<p>Specimens obtained at Kodiak in February are distinguishable from specimens
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">griseinucha</i>, obtained with them at the same place, only by their
much smaller size, and lighter chocolate tints. The occurrence of both these
races at the same place, at the same time, is a subject for speculation. A

of abdomen (and hinder part of breast to a less degree), flanks and crissum, with the rump
and upper tail-coverts, and lesser and middle wing-coverts, tipped with dark pomegranate
or rose-red, allowing more or less of thin dusky bases to be seen, especially above, where
there is an appearance of bars. Wing and tail feathers brown, nearly all, including the
greater wing-coverts, edged with pale yellowish-gray with only a faint tinge of rose. Bill
dusky; darkest at tip. Legs black.</p>

<p>This is considerably the largest of the American species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leucosticte</i>, and
has a longer bill. It also has the chocolate and rose color darker, and the
rose extending farther forward on the breast than in other species. It could
only be confounded with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. littoralis</i> as to color, both having the head above,
and on the sides, ashy, covering the whole ear-coverts; but the dusky patch
on the crown is more extended, the ash of chin more restricted, and the
throat darker. The rose extends farther along the breast, and the tints are
different. The size is much larger.</p>

<p>A specimen, apparently young, perhaps a female, differs in duller tints,
and a tinge of ochreous-yellow on the middle of the abdomen and crissum.
The lining of the wings is without any rose-color.</p>

<p>Bonaparte and Schlegel describe the young of this species as without rose-color.</p>

<p>Specimens of this bird were obtained at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s Island, with the eggs
(which are white), by Mr. W. H. Dall. Dr. Minor found it at Unalaschka.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Gray-eared Finch is the largest species of this remarkable
genus known to inhabit North America. Thus far, except in one instance, it
has been met with only in the Aleutian Islands and Unalaschka. In the latter
place they were met with by Dr. T. T. Minor, and in the former by Mr. Dall.</p>

<p>Mr. R. Brown (Ibis, 1868, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 432) states that a single specimen of this
very rare bird was taken at Fort Rupert, Vancouver Island, in June, 1862,
by Mr. P. M. Compton, the officer in charge of that station. This, however,
may have belonged to the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">littoralis</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Dall states that they abound on the Pribylow and the other Aleutian
Islands. A number of specimens were obtained on the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s in August,
though at that time they were moulting. At that season this bird
had no song except a clear chirp, sounding like <i class="birdcall">wéet-a wèet-a-wée-weet</i>. It
was on the wing a great part of the time, rarely alighting on the ground, but
darting rapidly in a series of descending and ascending curves. At one time
it would swing on the broad top of an umbelliferous plant, and at another
alight on some ledge of the perpendicular bluff, jumping from point to point,
as if delighting to test its own agility. Mr. Dall adds that its nest is a
simple hollow on one of the ledges, provided with a few straws or a bit of
moss. They deposit their eggs in May, and these are four in number. In
August their young were fully fledged.</p>

<p>They feed on the seeds of grasses and other small plants, but in the crop
of one Mr. Dall found two or three small beetles. They were also received
from Kodiak, through Mr. Bischoff.</p>

<p>Their eggs are of a grayish-white, with a slight tinge of yellowish, and
measure .95 by .70 of an inch.</p>

<p>The species of this genus are essentially boreal and cosmopolitan, although
America possesses four species
not found, like her two others,
in the Old World. They are
all ground-birds, collecting in
large flocks, in autumn and
winter, on prairies and plains,
some of the species passing far
to the southward. There is
much variation in the color, and
in the details of structure of
bill and feet. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. nivalis</i>
alone is the fringe of bristly
feathers along the side of the bill very distinct. The gonys also is exceptionally
short, being less than half the length of the culmen.</p>

this has been done,&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. nivalis</i> being alone retained in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plectrophanes</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.

(Baird, 1858), and the rest coming under <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centrophanes</i> (Kaup). The characters
upon which these are based are very trivial, being mainly the varying
degree of size of the bill and length of the hind claw. In this latter respect
there is too much individual variation in the same species to admit of this
being available as a specific, much less as a subgeneric character, while the
size of the bill is not of more than specific importance.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Northern America from Atlantic to Pacific; south into the United States in
winter, as far as Georgia and Southern Illinois.</p>

<p>Specimens from North America and Europe appear to be quite identical;
there is, however, a great amount of variation among individuals.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Snow Bunting is found throughout northern North
America to the shores of the Arctic Sea, and in the winter months extends
its migrations into the United States as indicated above.</p>

<p>Mr. Dall states that in Alaska, when observed, they went altogether in
flocks. It was at times excessively common, and at others entirely absent.
It builds its nests on the hillside, generally on the ground, under the lee of
a stone. He obtained a large number of these birds at Nulato, in the winter
of 1867-68. It was much more common there than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. lapponicus</i>, which
was only seen in the spring, while this bird was there all the year round. Mr.
Dall also met with these birds on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s Island, and Mr. Bischoff obtained
them at Sitka. According to Mr. Bannister’s observations it was
altogether less abundant than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. lapponicus</i>, and seemed to prefer rather
<!--586.png--><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 513]</span>
different situations. On <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Island he never saw one of this species
far from the shore, while the other species was abundant everywhere in
the interior of the island. During the summer he never saw more than one
or two of these birds at once, nor anywhere except on rocky points or on
small rocky islands near the shore. These localities they seemed to share
with the Ravens and Puffins. In the autumn they are more gregarious, but
still seem to prefer the vicinity of water. Mr. Bannister also observed this
bird at Unalaklik, where it is common.</p>

<p>Wilson was of the opinion that these birds derive a considerable part of
their food from the seeds of certain aquatic plants, and this he supposed one
of the principal reasons why they prefer remote northern regions intersected
with streams, ponds, lakes, and arms of the sea, abounding with such plants.
On Seneca River, near Lake Ontario, in October, he met with a large flock
feeding on the surface of the water, supported on the close tops of weeds that
rose from the bottom. They were running about with great activity, and
the stomachs of those he shot were filled not only with the seeds of that
plant, but also with minute shell-fish that adhered to the leaves.</p>

<p>Richardson states that this species breeds in the most northern of our
Arctic islands, and on all the shores of the continent, from Chesterfield’s Inlet
to Behring Strait. The most southerly of its breeding-places known to him
was Southampton Island, in the <abbr title="sixty-second">62d</abbr> parallel, where Captain Lyons found
a nest on the grave of an Esquimaux child. Its nest was usually made
of dry grass, neatly lined with deer’s hair and a few feathers, and is generally
fixed in the crevice of a rock, or in a loose pile of timbers or stones.
The eggs are described as of a greenish-white, with a circle of irregular
umber-brown spots round the larger end, with numerous blotches of subdued
lavender-purple. July 22, in removing some drift timber on a beach at
Cape Parry, he discovered a nest on the ground, containing four young Snowbirds.
Care was taken not to injure them, and while they were seated at
breakfast, at a distance of only two or three feet, the parent birds made frequent
visits to their offspring, each time bringing grubs in their bills. The
Snowbirds are in no apparent haste to leave for the South on the approach
of winter, but linger about the forts and open places, picking up seeds, until
the snow becomes too deep. It is not until December or January that they
retire to the south of the Saskatchewan. It returns to that river about the
middle of February, by April it has reached the 65th parallel, and by the
beginning of May it is found on the shores of the Polar Sea. At this period
it feeds on the buds of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saxifraga oppositifolia</i>, one of the earliest of the
Arctic plants. The young are fed with insects.</p>

<p>The Snow Bunting is also an inhabitant, during the breeding-season, of
the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia, and the islands of the Arctic Sea.
Scoresby states that it resorts in large flocks to the shores of Spitzbergen, and
Captain Sabine includes it among the birds of Greenland and the North
Georgian Islands, where it is among the earliest arrivals. Mr. Proctor, who
<!--587.png--><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 514]</span>
visited Iceland in 1837, found the Snowbird breeding there in June. He
found their nests placed among large stones or in the fissures of rocks, composed
of dry grass lined with hair and feathers. The eggs were from four
to six in number. The male attends the female during incubation. Mr.
Proctor states that he has seen this bird, when coming from the nest, rise up
in the air and sing sweetly, with its wings and tail spread in the manner of
the Tree Pipit. Linnæus, in his Tour in Lapland, mentions seeing these birds
in that country about the end of May, and also in July. He also mentions
that this bird is the only living thing that has been seen two thousand feet
above the line of perpetual snow in the Lapland Alps. This bird also breeds
on the Faroe Islands. Mr. Hewitson found its nest in Norway. It contained
young, and was built under some loose stones. Young birds have also been
noticed early in August among the Grampians, in Scotland, rendering it probable
that they breed in that locality, and perhaps in considerable numbers.
As the severity of winter increases, they leave the heaths where they have
fed upon the seeds of grasses, and descend to the lowlands, frequenting the
oat-stubbles, and, when the snow is deep, approaching the coast. Their call-note
is pleasing, and is often repeated during their flight, which they make
in a very compact body. Before settling on the ground they make sudden
wheels, coming almost into collision with each other, uttering at the same
time a peculiar guttural note. They run on the ground with all the ease of
Larks, and rarely perch. Temminck states that they are very abundant in
winter along the sea-coast of Holland.</p>

<p>Their appearance in Massachusetts is usually with the first heavy falls of
snow, in December and January. They are most abundant in the open
places near the sea-coast, and formerly were very numerous in the marshes
between Boston and Brookline. A wounded male in full adult plumage was
taken by me, in 1838, and kept some time in confinement. It would not
accustom itself to a cage, and a large box was prepared in which it could
run more at large. It fed readily on grain and cracked corn, delighted to
bathe itself several times in the day, but would not be reconciled to my near
presence. On my approach it would rush about its prison, uttering its
peculiar call-notes, blending with them a loud guttural cry of alarm. As the
spring approached, it warbled occasionally a few notes, but uttered from time
to time such mournful cries, as if bewailing its captivity, that it would have
been released, had its crippled condition permitted it to take care of itself.
It was given in charge of a friend, but did not live through the heat of the
ensuing summer.</p>

<p>It is stated that a nest of this bird was found among the White Mountains
by Mr. Kirk Boott, of Boston, in the summer of 1834. It contained
young birds. This, if the identification was correct, was probably an accidental
occurrence. None have been noticed there since, nor have I ever been
able to find any of the permanent residents among the mountains that have
met with these birds in that region, except in winter.</p>

<p><!--588.png--><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 515]</span>
The only authenticated nest and eggs (10,433) in the Smithsonian collection
were received from Mr. R. MacFarlane, with the parent, taken on the
Arctic coast east of Fort Anderson, and having on the label, “Nest situated
in a cave in a sand-bank.” The nest is deeply saucer-shaped, and composed
of wiry grass-stems, with a few feathers in the lining; external diameter
3.75 inches, internal about 3.00; depth, 2.50 externally and 1.50 internally.
The eggs, five in number, are of a dull white, with perhaps a faint bluish
cast, sprinkled and spattered with dilute yellowish-rufous, the markings most
numerous toward the larger end; they measure .95 of an inch in length by .64
in breadth.</p>

Northern portions of the Old and the New
World; breeding in arctic and subarctic regions, and
in winter descending southward, as far at least as New York, Southern Illinois, and Fort
Garland, New Mexico.</p>

<p>Autumnal specimens, of both sexes, differ in having the pattern of coloration
obscured by ochraceous borders to the feathers, and a general rusty cast
to the plumage.</p>

<p>There appears to be no difference between North American and European
specimens of this bird.</p>

<p><!--589.png--><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 516]</span>
<span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Lapland Longspur is an Arctic resident, belonging equally
to the two continents, rarely descending even in winter to temperate regions,
and then chiefly in its immature plumage. In Europe, according to Yarrell,
only a few specimens have been found in the British Islands, and these
were single individuals, mostly found in company with Larks. They have
also been taken in France, in Belgium, and in different parts of Germany.
Degland states that these birds are occasionally snared on the coast at Dunkirk,
and in the neighborhood of Antwerp, but these are always young
males in their winter plumage.</p>

<p>Pennant states that it is found in Siberia, and near the Ural Mountains,
migrating in the winter as far south as Switzerland; and, according to
Necker, they have also been taken, always in company with Larks, in the
vicinity of Geneva. It inhabits Norway, Sweden, the Faroe Islands, Spitzbergen,
Iceland, and Greenland, in the summer.</p>

<p>Richardson mentions that the Lapland Bunting is common in the fur regions,
wintering on the coast of Hudson’s Bay. During its stay it feeds on
grass-seed, the fruit of the juniper, and the pines. As he never met with
these birds during the winter, he suspects that their principal retreats are on
the borders of Lakes Huron and Superior, and the country westward. In
1827 they appeared on the plains, at the Carlton House, about the middle
of May, in very large flocks, in company with Shore Larks and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. picta</i>,
frequenting the open spots where the fires had destroyed the grass. In
the same season they came a few days later to the Cumberland House, and
kept constantly about the furrows of the new-ploughed fields. The year
before they had been, in smaller flocks, in the vicinity of Fort Franklin,
latitude 65<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, in the beginning of May. Their crops were found filled with
seeds of the alpine arbutus.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon met with them in enormous flocks in Kentucky, about February
15, 1819. They were in company with the Shore Larks and the Snow
Buntings. None of these were in perfect plumage.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway cites this as a common winter visitant in Southern Illinois,
abundant in unusually severe winters, either in large flocks by itself, or a
few individuals mixed up in flocks of Shore Larks.</p>

<p>Mr. Dall gives May 12 as the date of the first arrival of these birds at
Nulato, and adds that it is not at any time a very common bird. He was
not able to find its nest at Nulato, but was informed by the Indians that it
builds on the bare hillsides, in hillocks of grass, and that it does not leave the
nest when any one approaches, but sits perfectly still, and thus often escapes
detection. He considers it a very fine singer. Specimens were received from
Sitka, obtained by Bischoff. To this account Mr. Bannister adds that it is
by far the most abundant of the land-birds found at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s. It appeared
on that island about the 6th of May, and from that time until about
the middle or latter part of September they were observed in great numbers
all over the island. He, too, was not successful in finding its nest, though
<!--590.png--><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 517]</span>
the birds were started up by hundreds on every walk over the island. From
this he infers that they must be very carefully concealed. He often searched
for them, but always with the same result. Mr. Bannister regarded this
species as decidedly the best songster of its family.</p>

<p>In the far North it is an extremely abundant species from one ocean to
the other, in the winter moving farther south, to the United States, in large
flocks. It has not been found in California, but in the central and eastern
regions has been obtained as far south as Leavenworth, Kan., Racine, <abbr title="Wisconsin">Wis.</abbr>,
Boston, and New York. It is stated by different observers, that, like the
Lark, it sings only while in motion in the air, or while suspended, and that
its notes are agreeable and melodious.</p>

<p>According to Richardson, they breed in moist meadows on the shores of
the Arctic Sea, the nest being placed in a small hillock, among moss and
stones. It is composed externally of dry stems of grass, interwoven to a
considerable thickness, and lined very neatly and compactly with deer’s hair.
The eggs, seven in number, he describes as pale ochre-yellow, spotted with
brown. Sir James Ross found them by no means numerous in the higher
northern latitudes, and obtained one nest, containing five eggs, in July.</p>

<p>According to Holböll, this bird is common along the shores of both North
and South Greenland. They reach Godhaab in the beginning of May, and
Godhaven a month later. Their migrations do not take place all at once,
but they are constantly arriving during the month. It remains in South
Greenland until the beginning of September, and longer if the deep snows
do not drive it away. This bird is never met on shipboard until the vessels
are in Davis Strait, proving that their migrations must be from America.
The Greenlanders call it Narksamatak (inhabitant of the plains),&mdash;an appropriate
name, as it only lives on the lowlands near the sea-shore, where it
builds its nest in the manner of the Lark, in the grass, or among the lichens.
Its five eggs, of a dirty olive-color spotted with brown, are smaller than those
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. nivalis</i>. The song of the male bird, as it hovers in the air or rocks on
a swaying twig, is very clear and melodious. It is even known as the Greenland
Nightingale. Its food is seeds, and it is not known to seek insect-larvæ
on the houses of the Greenlanders, as does the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. nivalis</i>. In their
winter dress they all resemble the female in her summer plumage, only in
the male some black is seen in the head-feathers.</p>

<p>Fabricius describes its eggs as five or six in number, of a reddish-gray
with brownish spots. Degland describes their ground-color as an ashy-gray,
covered with spots of light brown, with lines and spots of deep brown, and
also of clear black.</p>

<p>Eggs from Anderson River exhibit great variations in their appearance,
more from the difference in the distribution of their spots than from variations
in colors. Where distinctly visible, the ground-color appears to be of
yellowish-gray, frequently so thickly spotted as not to be recognizable. The
blotches are of various shades of brown, with shadings of olive, purple, or
<!--591.png--><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 518]</span>
red, and at times almost black. In some, fine olive-brown dots cover the egg
so completely as to make it appear as of one uniform deep color. In others
the brown is lighter and more of a reddish hue, and again in others the
markings are in irregular distribution, and of different shades. They measure
.80 by .60 of an inch.</p>

<p>Nest with eggs (7414), collected on Anderson River, Franklin Bay, June
27, by R. MacFarlane, was built on the ground, and is deeply saucer-shaped,
measuring 3.75 in external and 2.30 in internal diameter; the depth 2.75
exteriorly and 1.50 interiorly. It is composed of coarse wiry grass-stems,
and softly lined with feathers of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lagopus</i>. The eggs, five in number, have
the ground-color light umber-drab, this faintly blotched with deeper livid
slate, and with a few straggly black lines, much as in certain <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icteridæ</i> and
in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chondestes</i>. They measure .86 of an inch in length by .63 in breadth.</p>

<i class="sex">Male.</i> Spring. Top and sides of head black. A line from bill over the
eye, lores, lower and posterior border of the black cheeks, ears (encircled by black), and a
small patch in the nape, white. Entire under parts, and extending round neck to nape
(where it bounds abruptly the black of head), buff or light cinnamon-yellow; the under
tail-covert paler; the inside of wings, white. Feathers of upper surfaces black, edged
with yellowish-gray; shoulders or lesser coverts and the greater black; middle white,
forming a conspicuous patch. Quills edged externally with white, this involving the
whole outer web of outermost primary. Whole of outer and most of second tail-feather
white. Bill dusky; lower mandible and legs yellowish. Length, 5.50; wing, 3.50;
tail, 2.75; bill, .45.</p>

<p class="small"><i class="sex">Female.</i> The markings of male faintly indicated, but the black and buff wanting.
Head above brown, streaked centrally with paler. A narrow dark line on each side the
throat, and brownish streaks across the jugulum, and along sides of body. Traces visible
of the white marks of the head. Bill and feet as in the male.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Prairies of Illinois and Missouri Plains, in winter; in summer north to the
Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>This species is quite similar in form to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. lapponicus</i>, although with slenderer
bill, and perhaps longer hind claw. While the colors of adult males
are very different, the females have a decided resemblance; they may, however,
be distinguished in all stages by the black or dusky legs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lapponicus</i>
and the yellow of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pictus</i>, and perhaps by the more dusky upper mandible of
the latter.</p>

<p><!--592.png--><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 519]</span>
<span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species was first obtained by Sir John Richardson’s party,
and described by Swainson in the <cite>Fauna Boreali-Americana</cite>. It was observed
associating with the Lapland Buntings on the banks of the Saskatchewan,
but no information was obtained in regard to its breeding-habits. No
specimens in the mature plumage are known to have been obtained in the
United States, but birds in the immature plumage are not unfrequent, in
early spring, throughout Illinois. Mr. Audubon, in company with Mr. Harris
and Mr. Bell, obtained specimens of these birds near Edwardsville, and
described them as a new species. Mr. Bell states, in regard to these birds,
that he found them very abundant on the low prairie near a lake, a few miles
from Edwardsville. They were generally in large flocks, and when once
on the ground they began to separate. They ran very nimbly, in a manner
resembling that of the Grass Finch, and when they arose, which they rarely
did unless they were nearly approached, they uttered a sharp click, repeated
several times in quick succession, and moved with an easy undulating motion
for a short distance and then alighted very suddenly, seeming to fall perpendicularly
several feet to the ground. They preferred the spots where the
grass was shortest. When in the air they flew in circles, to and fro, for a few
minutes, and then alighted, keeping up a constant chirping or call, somewhat
like that of the Red-Poll.</p>

<p>These birds were observed in large numbers at Fort Anderson, and on the
Lower Anderson River, by Mr. MacFarlane, and a large number of their
nests obtained. These were all on the ground, and usually in open spaces,
but also in the vicinity of trees. The usual number of eggs found in a nest
appears to have been four. The nests, for the most part, were constructed
of fine dry grasses, carefully arranged, and lined with down, feathers, or finer
materials similar to those of the outer portions. In a few there were no feathers;
in others, feathers in different proportions; and in a few the down and
feathers composed the chief portion of the nest, with only a few leaves as a
base to the nest. They were sometimes sunk in excavations made by the
birds, or placed in a tussock of grass, and, in one instance, placed in the
midst of a bed of Labrador tea.</p>

<p>They were also obtained at Fort Yukon, at the mouth of Porcupine River,
by Strachan Jones. They were much more abundant in the Mackenzie River
district.</p>

<p>Specimens of this bird, in the fall plumage, were obtained from Fort
Simpson, where Mr. B. R. Ross states that it appears on its way north in
May. They resort to the fields around the fort in search of grain. Although
these birds keep entirely apart from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. nivalis</i>, Mr. Ross has frequently
observed several <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. lapponicus</i> associating with them.</p>

<p>When their nests are approached, the female quietly slips off, while the
male bird may be seen hopping or flying from tree to tree in the neighborhood
of the nest, and will at times do all he can to induce intruders to withdraw
from the neighborhood.</p>

<p><!--593.png--><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 520]</span>
The eggs, five in number, have a light clay-colored ground, are marked
with obscure blotches of lavender and darker lines, dots, and blotches of
dark purplish-brown. They measure .80 by .65 of an inch.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Plains of the Upper Missouri. San Antonio, Texas, spring (<span class="sc">Dresser</span>, Ibis, 1865,
486).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species was first discovered by Mr. Townsend, who procured
a single specimen, a male, on the Upper Missouri River. He describes
it as by no means a common bird, keeping in pairs and living exclusively on
the ground. It was remarkably shy, and Mr. Townsend was not able to procure
more than a single specimen.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall states that he met with this bird early in May, on the wide
grassy plains of the Platte. The birds were already paired for the season.
He heard them utter no notes other than a chirp, as they kept busily foraging
for their subsistence.</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. Allen (American Naturalist, May, 1872) speaks of this bird and
the Lark Bunting as by far the most interesting species seen by him in
Western Kansas. They were not only characteristic of the region, but were
also among the few birds strictly confined to the arid plains. They were
quite abundant, but were only met with on the high ridges and dry plateaus,
where they seemed to live somewhat in colonies. At a few localities they
were always numerous, but elsewhere would be frequently not met with in
a whole day’s drive. They were very wary and tenacious of life, often flying
a long distance after having been shot through vital parts. Most of the
specimens had to be killed on the wing, at a long range. They are strong
fliers, and seem to delight in flying in the strongest gales, when all the other
birds appear to move with difficulty, and to keep themselves concealed among
the grass. This bird sings while on the wing.</p>

<p><!--594.png--><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 521]</span>
Mr. H. E. Dresser, in his paper on the birds of Southern Texas, mentions
finding the Chestnut-collared Bunting in flocks early in the spring, on the
prairies near San Antonio, but it was not a common bird there.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse found this species quite rare in the Indian Territory, where
he was only able to secure a single specimen.</p>

<p>Captain Blakiston met with this species on the Saskatchewan Plains on
the 15th of May, 1858,&mdash;a higher range than has been noticed by any one
else.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann, while on a trip to the Rocky Mountains in 1843, met with
this species in small flocks and pairs, scattered over the prairies of the Platte
River, and was so fortunate as to meet with one of its nests. It was built
on the ground, and was made of an interweaving of fine grasses and lined
with hair. He describes the eggs, which were four in number, as having a
white ground, with black lines at the larger end, and a few faint blotches of
a neutral tint scattered over their whole surface.</p>

<p>This description does not quite correspond with the eggs collected by Mr.
Audubon on the Upper Missouri. These have a clay-colored ground with the
slightest possible tinge of green, and are marked with fine dots of purplish-brown,
and larger markings, blotches, and short lines of dark brown. They
measure .70 by .55 of an inch, and have a strong resemblance to the eggs of
both <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. pictus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. maccowni</i>.</p>

<p>Five eggs of this species, obtained at Fort Hays, Kansas, June 1, 1871, by
Mr. J. A. Allen, measure .75 of an inch in length by .58 in breadth. They
are small in proportion to the bird, and are somewhat pointed at one end.
Their ground is a gray or grayish-white shade of stone-color, and this is
somewhat sparingly marked with blotches of dark brown, almost black, and
lighter markings of purplish-brown. The nest was placed on the ground, and
was composed altogether of fine stems of grasses.</p>

<p><!--595.png--><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 522]</span>
As already stated, this bird is very similar to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. ornatus</i>. It appears to
be a very little larger, or, at any rate, with considerably longer wings.
The bill, however, is shorter and stouter; the hind claw decidedly longer.
The chestnut of the back of the neck is darker. The white on the outer
web of the tertiaries and secondaries is much purer and wider. The
rufous margins of the pectoral feathers we have never seen in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. ornatus</i>.
The most striking peculiarity, however, is in having the shoulders black,
instead of brown like the rest of the wing-feathers, edged with paler. Both
have the white posterior row of lesser wing-coverts.</p>

<p>An immature male (6,291) has the black of the head mixed with brown,
and a maxillary series of spots on each side of the throat. A female has a
similar series of spots; the under parts generally being brownish-white, the
shafts across the breast and along the sides streaked with brown, the concealed
portions of the feathers light brown, fading out to the whitish exterior.
There is no black on the shoulder, nor chestnut on the nape.</p>

<p>Fully mature specimens of this bird and of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ornatus</i> are so rare in collections
as to render it difficult to decide positively as to their true relationship.
It is by no means impossible that they merely represent different conditions
of plumage of one species, but for the present, at least, we prefer to consider
them as distinct. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. melanomus</i> is resident on the table-lands of
Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Of the habits and general history of this species, very little
is known. Its close resemblance to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. ornatus</i> is suggestive of its probably
equally close similarity in nesting, eggs, and manner of feeding. Specimens
have been received from Mexico, from Fort Thorn, from New Mexico, Pole
Creek, and the Black Hills. From the last-named places they were obtained
in August and September.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann, in his Report on the birds observed in Lieutenant Parke’s
route near the <abbr title="thirty-second">32d</abbr> parallel, mentions having met with these birds, which
he calls the Black-shouldered Longspur, at a large prairie-dog village some
miles west of Puerto del Dado. They were in flocks, and were associated
with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. maccowni</i>. From that point to the Rio Grande he found both of
these species abundant wherever they struck isolated water-holes, these being
the only places for miles around where drink can be procured. When shot
at, they rise as if to go away, but are forced to return, after describing a few
curves, to the only spot where they can procure their necessary drink. They
may thus be killed in great numbers. Dr. Heermann states that he has seen
from a hundred to a hundred and fifty thus brought down in four or five
discharges of a gun.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser states that on the 4th of April a small flock of what was
at first supposed to be the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. ornatus</i> was noticed near the town of San
Antonio. They were pursued, and found on the banks of the San Pedro.
They were not very shy, and specimens were procured which proved to be
of this species. This is the only time that they have been observed in
<!--598.png--><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 523]</span>
that part of the country, though they may have been mistaken for other
species.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Maccown’s Lark Bunting is yet another of the various species
of our birds whose history is very little known, and in regard to which the
most we are able to state, at present, is that they appear in different parts
of the interior plains of the United States, between the Rocky Mountains
and the Missouri River and the lower tributaries of the Mississippi,
extending from New Mexico and Texas northward, during the breeding-season,
<!--599.png--><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 524]</span>
to the northern boundary of the United States. It was first discovered
by Captain Maccown, who obtained it in Texas, where he found it
in company with a flock of Shore Larks, and where it winters in considerable
numbers. Mr. Dresser afterward met with it in small flocks, early in
April, on the prairies near San Antonio. It was not very common, and he
was only able to obtain two specimens during his stay in that section.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann found this species congregated in large flocks, in company
with the Black-shouldered Bunting. They were engaged in gleaning the
seeds from the scanty grass, on the vast arid plains of New Mexico. Insects
and berries formed also a part of their food; in search of these they showed
great activity, running about with celerity and ease. In the spring, large
flocks were seen at Fort Thorn, having migrated thither from the North
the previous fall. With the return of mild weather they again departed
for the North for the purposes of incubation. Among these large flocks Dr.
Heermann noticed also the Shore Lark, but they formed only a small proportion
of the whole number.</p>

<p>In a letter to Mr. Cassin, Dr. Heermann states that he found this species
congregated with large numbers of other birds about the isolated water-holes
in the barren plains of New Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. Allen states (<abbr title="American Naturalist">Am. Nat.</abbr>, May, 1872) that, during a few weeks’ stay
near Fort Hays in midwinter, he found Maccown’s Longspur tolerably frequent
in that vicinity.</p>

<p>An egg of this species, in the collection of the late Dr. Henry Bryant,
measures .80 by .60 of an inch. Its ground-color is a light bluish clay-color,
marbled, dotted, blotched, and lined with light neutral tints of lavender and
darker markings of purplish and reddish brown. The nest was placed on
the ground, and is composed entirely of coarse grass-stems (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3,521, J.

<p>The introduction into the United States, at so many distant points, of the
European House Sparrow (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyrgita domestica</i>) renders it necessary to introduce
it with any work treating of the birds of North America, although
totally different in so many features from our own native forms. I follow
Degland and Gerbe in placing the genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyrgita</i> in a separate subfamily
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyrgitinæ</i>, see page 446), without any distinct idea of its true
affinities, as it does not come legitimately within any of the subfamilies
established for the American genera. In some respects similar to certain
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coccothraustinæ</i>, in the short tarsi and covered nostrils, the wings are shorter
and more rounded, the sides of the bill with stiff bristles, etc. The much
larger, more vaulted bill, weaker feet, and covered nostrils, distinguish it from

<p>The House Sparrow of Europe has been introduced into so many parts
of the United States as to render it probable that at no distant day it
will have become one of our most familiar species. Brought over to the
New World within a comparatively few years, it has commenced to multiply
about the larger cities, especially in the environs of New York, as also
about Portland, Boston, Newark, and Philadelphia. The first effort made to
naturalize it about Washington failed in consequence of the death of three
hundred individuals imported by the Smithsonian Institution. A second,
<!--601.png--><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 526]</span>
however, in 1871, was more successful. One thousand birds were let loose
in the public squares of Philadelphia in the spring of 1869. In and about
Havana it is said to be common, as also about Great Salt Lake, where it
was recently introduced by the Mormons, according to Mr. J. A. Allen.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common House Sparrow of Europe has, within the past few
years, achieved a right to a place in the
avi-fauna of North America by its complete
introduction, and its reproduction in
large numbers, in various parts of the
country, from Portland, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>, to Washington
City, as also about Salt Lake.</p>

<p>The first attempt to introduce these
birds, within my knowledge, was made
by a gentleman named Deblois, in Portland,
<abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>, in the fall of 1858. Six birds
were set at liberty in a large garden in the central part of the city.
They remained in the neighborhood through the winter, and in the sheltering
porch of a neighboring church they found places of shelter and
security. In the following spring three nests were built in dwarf pear-trees
in the garden in which they were first set at liberty. One, at
least, of these nests, was successfully occupied, and six young birds were
reared from it. A second nest, with four young, was also hatched by the
same pair. Neither of these nests was globular in shape, but open and
coarse, built of hay and straws. These nests were taken, after their use, and
came into my possession. Since then I have been informed that these birds
increased and multiplied, and for a while were quite abundant in that portion
of the city, and a large colony of this Sparrow appeared in the winter of
1871 in Rockland, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr></p>

<p>Two years later, Mr. Eugene Schieffelin, of New York, imported and set
at liberty, near Madison Square, in that city, twelve of these birds, and this
he repeated for several successive summers. In 1864, fourteen birds were
set at liberty in Central Park, by the Commissioners. Other birds were also
brought from England, by different parties, in the Cunard steamers, and released
at Jersey City. These have increased very largely, and have spread
to the adjoining cities, until these birds have become familiar and social residents
in all the large cities and towns within an extended area around New
York, as well as in all parts of that city.</p>

<p>They were introduced into Boston by the City Government in 1868. Two
hundred birds were purchased in Germany, but unfortunately all died on
their passage except about a score. These were set at liberty in June, but,
weakened by their sea-voyage, several of them were found dead in the deer-park,
and the rest disappeared. The following summer more were imported,
but all died except ten. These were well cared for, and only released
when in excellent condition. For some months nothing was seen of these
<!--602.png--><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 527]</span>
birds, and the experiment was supposed to be a failure, when it was ascertained
that they had betaken themselves to the vicinity of stables in the
southern part of the city, had increased and multiplied in large numbers,
reappearing in the winter to the number of one hundred and fifty. They
were regularly fed by the city forester each day in the deer-park, and roosted
at night in the thatch of the roofs of the buildings. Since then they have
very largely increased. About twenty, that same summer, were set at liberty
in Monument Square, Charlestown.</p>

<p>In 1869 about one thousand birds were imported, by the City Government,
into Philadelphia. Fortunately they came in good condition, and being
released early in May immediately separated into scattered parties and prepared
for themselves new homes. Some appeared in Morristown and other
distant towns in New Jersey. Others wandered to Germantown, and the
remoter suburbs of Philadelphia, where they found the cherry-trees in full
blossom, and where their exploits in stripping the blooms from the trees
gave a not very favorable first impression of these new-comers.</p>

<p>It has been exceedingly interesting to watch the manners and habits of
these strangers in their new homes. They have become quite tame, are fearless
and gentle, and as they have been very kindly treated live in a condition
of semi-domestication. At first they built their nests, and passed their winters,
in New York, among the thick ivies that cover the walls of so many
churches, in such cases building globular nests. As soon, however, as suitable
boxes were prepared for them in sufficient quantities, these were taken
possession of in preference to anything else.</p>

<p>At the time of their introduction the shade-trees in the parks and squares
of New York, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Newark, and other places, were greatly
infested with the larvæ of the measure-worms that destroyed their foliage.
Since then these worms have almost entirely disappeared. A doubt has
been expressed whether the Sparrows destroy these insects. That they
eat them in the larvæ form I do not know, but to their destruction of the
chrysalis, the moth, and the eggs, I can testify, having been eye-witness
to the act.</p>

<p>Apprehensions have been expressed lest these new-comers may molest and
drive away our own native birds. How this may be when the Sparrows
become more numerous cannot now be determined, but so far they manifest
no such disposition. Since their introduction into Boston the Chipping
Sparrows appear to have increased, and to associate by preference with their
European visitors, feeding with them unmolested. I have been unable to
detect a single instance in which they have been molested, in any manner,
by their larger companions. Their predatory aggressions, however, upon the
rights of the common Robin have been noticed, and deserve mention. The
Sparrows appear to be extravagantly fond of earthworms, but not able to
hunt for them themselves. They have learned to watch the Robin as it
forages for these worms, keeping around, at a respectful distance, and as soon
<!--603.png--><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 528]</span>
as one, with much toil, has dragged a worm from its place of concealment,
down swoops the bird and impudently carries it off. The poor bewildered
and plundered Robin essays a late and vain attempt to protect its food.
The Sparrow is too nimble, and the worm is gone before its rightful owner
can turn to face the robber.</p>

<p>The Sparrows endure the severest of the winter weather without any
apparent inconvenience, appearing as cheerful, contented, and noisy with the
thermometer at zero as at any other time. They are quite fearless, especially
in New York, running about under the feet of the passers-by with perfect
indifference and confidence. In Boston I have noticed their nests in convenient
places, a few feet above crowded sidewalks. In winter they come
regularly about the houses to be fed.</p>

<p>The House Sparrow has also been introduced into Australia, where it has
become acclimated, and was, at the last accounts, rapidly increasing in that
quarter. It is likewise very common about Havana, Cuba.</p>

<p>In the Old World this bird has a widely extended area of distribution, and
is resident wherever found. It is very abundant in the British Islands and
throughout the northern and central portions of Europe. In Spain and in
Italy it is replaced by two closely allied species or races. This bird, however,
is also found in North Africa, in the Levant, at Trebizonde, and among
the mountains of Nubia. Specimens have also been received from the Himalayas,
from Nepaul, and the vicinity of Calcutta.</p>

<p>Both in Europe and in this country the Sparrows pair early in the season.
I have known them sitting on their eggs, in Boston, in March. They are
very prolific, have broods of five, six, and even seven at a time, three or four
times in a season. They are full of life and animation, somewhat disposed
to brief and noisy quarrels, which are always harmless.</p>

<p>Their great attachment and devotion to their young is dwelt upon by all
English writers as quite remarkable. They evince a great partiality for
warmth, and even in midsummer line their nests with all the feathers they
can pick up. In New York it is a favorite amusement with the children to
carry with them to the public parks quantities of feathers, which they throw,
one by one, to the Sparrows, to witness their amusing contests for possession.</p>

<p>The eggs of this bird are oval in shape, pointed at one end, with a ground
of a light ashen color, blotched, dotted, and streaked with various shades of
ashy and dusky brown. They measure from .85 to .95 of an inch in length,
and from .60 to .65 in breadth.</p>

<p>This genus differs from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerculus</i>, as stated in the description of the
species farther on. It would be taken for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plectrophanes</i> on account of its

the tarsi are much longer, the tertials less elongated, and the coloration different,

<p>This species has somewhat of the general appearance of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerculus

is much longer, and more slender in proportion. The wings are quite unusually

<p>The species was based by Mr.
Audubon on a skin brought by him from the mouth of the Yellowstone
River, in 1843, in rather defective and worn plumage. This has hitherto
<!--607.png--><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 532]</span>
served as the basis of all the descriptions of the species which is justly
considered one of the rarest in the North American fauna.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> In regard to the habits, distribution, or general history of this
very rare species, but little is known, only one specimen having been met
with. This was procured by Mr. Audubon’s party to the Yellowstone River,
in Dakota, on the last day of July, 1843. That it is a resident where obtained,
certainly during the breeding-season, is a natural inference from the
circumstances of its capture. That it may be a common bird in certain
other portions of the region, immediately north of Dakota, is quite probable.
Its close habits, as described by Mr. Audubon, favor its escaping notice wherever
it may exist.</p>

<p>The specimen was met with in a wet place, overgrown closely by a kind
of slender rush-like grass, from the midst of which the notes of these birds
were heard, and at first mistaken for those of the Marsh Wren. A search
was immediately instituted for the singers, which Mr. Bell soon ascertained
could not be the Wren in question, the notes being much softer and more
prolonged. Much difficulty was encountered in the endeavor to raise them
from the long close grass to which they closely confined themselves, and
they were several times nearly trodden on before they would take wing,
almost instantaneously realighting within a few steps, and running like mice
through the grass. After a while two were shot while on the wing, and
proved to be adult male and female. The party found this species quite
abundant in all such situations, and there seems to have been no doubt that
it was breeding.</p>

<p>A careful examination of the very large series of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerculus</i> allied to
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">savanna</i> in the museum of the Smithsonian Institution, recently made,
<!--609.png--><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 534]</span>
brings us to the same conclusion as that reached in 1858, namely, that,
granting a single species extending over the whole of North America, there
are several geographical races in different
regions. Thus, taking the eastern bird
as the standard, with its dark colors,
reddish wings, and deep yellow superciliary
stripe, and the comparative or
entire absence of spots on the lower part
of breast, we have in the middle province,
and to some extent in the western,
a race rather smaller, with more attenuated
and longer bill, and paler colors;
the wings grayish, the yellow of head
being scarcely appreciable (<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alaudinus</i>).
On the coast of California, another
series of the size and proportions of the last, but with dark yellow
superciliary stripe,&mdash;the vertex-stripe even yellowish,&mdash;dark colors, and
the lower part of breast, as well as the throat, decidedly streaked, as well
as the jugulum (<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anthinus</i>); and finally on the northwest coast, from
Puget Sound to Kodiak, a fourth race, much larger than typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. savanna</i>,
but absolutely undistinguishable in color, proportion of bill, etc. (<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sandwichensis</i>).
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. anthinus</i> is not found north of California, but the other two
of the western race may occur together at any point of the coast north,
perhaps, of the Columbia River.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Savanna Sparrow is an abundant species throughout North
America, from the Atlantic sea-board to the Great Plains. It is, however,
everywhere much less common in the interior than nearer the shore. The
Smithsonian specimens are from points as far south as Georgia and Louisiana,
and as far west as the Black Hills of Wyoming. It passes north through
Massachusetts, from the first to the middle of April, and some remain to breed
in the eastern part of the State. Mr. Maynard speaks of it as a common
summer resident. This, however, is true only of a few restricted maritime
localities, but is not so of the entire eastern portion of the State. It occurs
both in the salt marshes of Charles River and in the vicinity of Fresh Pond,
but I could never trace it in any of the neighboring towns. It is occasionally
met with in inland situations where we would not naturally look for it.
In the summer of 1869, Mr. William Brewster found quite a colony of these
birds in an open field near the Glen House, at the foot of <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr> Washington.
They had nests with eggs the last of July and the first of August.</p>

<p>In Western Massachusetts, according to Mr. Allen, it rarely or never stops
to breed. In Western Maine, Mr. Verrill mentions it as a common summer
visitant, and as breeding there in the latter part of May. In the vicinity of
Eastport, and in all the islands of the Grand Menan group, I found these
Sparrows very abundant. They almost invariably built their nests in depressions
on the edge or just under the projecting tops of high bluffs of land
near the sea. They were by far the most abundant of the land-birds, and it
was quite common to find their nests in close proximity one to another.
They arrive there in April, and leave in September, passing slowly south
more in reference to the abundance of their food than the severity of the
season, until the weather becomes very severe, when they all disappear. They
winter in the Southern States, from Virginia to Georgia, and are especially
abundant in the Carolinas. Dr. Coues states that they were very common
about Columbia from October to April, moving in large flocks and associating
with other species. Wilson states that he met with this species, from
Savannah to New York, in all the low country, and regarded it as resident
in those places, but rarely found at a distance from the sea-shore. He found
them especially numerous at Great Egg Harbor, <abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr></p>

<p><!--611.png--><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 536]</span>
Dr. Coues, in his visit to Labrador, in 1860, found this Sparrow abundant
in that region in low moist meadows and marshy tracts near the sea-shore,
but never noticed it in any other situations. He frequently observed it there
feeding on the beds of dried eel-grass along the rocky shores, searching for
food in company with the Titlarks and small Sandpipers.</p>

<p>During my visits to the islands of the Bay of Fundy, in one of which I
remained a number of days, I had a good opportunity to notice these birds.
In many respects their habits undergo noticeable changes during the breeding-season.
As they pass north or south in their migrations, they are not
particularly shy or difficult to approach, but when they had nests they seemed
to become particularly cautious and mistrustful. The male and female sat
by turns upon their eggs, but generally one remained within hailing distance,
and always gave promptly a signal of danger when the nest was approached,
at which the other would glide from the nest, running off on the ground like
a mouse. I found it impossible to identify by shooting the parent on the
nest, and only accomplished its identification by means of snares. When
once lost in the tall grass, it was impossible to find it again, or if it reappeared
it was impossible to tell which of the many chirping Sparrows, all of
them out of reach of shot, and keeping a sharp lookout on my movements,
had any connection with the nest. This manœuvre was gone through with
in every nest I found, but I soon learned to distinguish them without the
need of gun or snare.</p>

<p>This Sparrow is eminently terrestrial, confining itself almost entirely to
the ground, and rarely alighting on anything even so high as a fence.
Though frequenting low moist grounds, its nest is always in a dry spot and
usually somewhat elevated. The nest is almost always sunk into the ground,
is made very simply and loosely of dry grasses, with a lining of softer materials
of the same. I have never found any other material than this in the
many nests I have examined, although nests of <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alaudinus</i>, in the vicinity
of Fort Anderson, are frequently lined with feathers or deers’ hair,
according to MacFarlane.</p>

<p>The eggs, five or six in number, vary considerably in their appearance. In
shape they are a rounded oval, one end being much more pointed than the
other. They measure .68 by .55 of an inch. In some the ground-color,
which is of a greenish-white, is plainly visible, being only partially covered
by blotches of brown, shaded with red and purple. These blotches are more
numerous about the larger end, becoming confluent and forming a corona.
In others, the ground-color is entirely concealed by confluent ferruginous
fine dots, over which are darker markings of brown and purple and a still
darker ring of the same about the larger end.</p>

stripe; but the bill is always decidedly more attenuated in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alaudinus</i>.</p>

<p>The Western Savanna Sparrow is a common species throughout the Western
Province of North America, from the plains to California, and from
Alaska to Mexico. In California it appears to be replaced along the Pacific
coast by the variety <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anthinus</i>, a quite different and very local form. In
Alaska, specimens were obtained by the naturalists of the Russian Telegraph
Expedition at various localities, chiefly in the interior, and on the
Yukon it was obtained by Mr. Lockhart. Dr. Cooper found it at Fort
Steilacoom, in Washington Territory, where it was in company with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. sandwichensis</i>,
in the wet meadows. In California this species inhabits chiefly,
according to Dr. Cooper, the dry plains of the interior of the State. The
statement of the occurrence of this form anywhere along the coast of California
should be received with considerable doubt, since in the large series
of these birds all specimens from this region are of the variety <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anthinus</i>,
an exclusively littoral type.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Western Savanna Sparrow was found throughout the Great
Basin, by Mr. Ridgway, in all wet, grassy situations, in which preference it
is like its eastern relative. It was very abundant at Carson City, inhabiting
exclusively the meadows. At Salt Lake City it was also very abundant,
frequenting the wet meadows near the Jordan.</p>

<p>This bird was also obtained at Sitka by Bischoff, and was found on the
Yukon by Mr. Lockhart. It is the only species found in the Valley of the
Mackenzie, up to the Arctic coast.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper also met with it among the low meadows of Washington Territory,
<!--613.png--><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 538]</span>
where they arrived in March, and remained until late in October.
They were usually found among the grass, from which they rarely rise,
except to sing their faint and lisping trill from a weed or some low bush.
Mr. Ridgway represents this song as corresponding with the syllables <i class="birdcall">witz-witz-wih´-tzull</i>.
This, he states, is uttered in a weak and lisping manner, as
the bird perches on a bush beside the brook, or on a fence, or as it nestles
among the grass on the ground.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper speaks of them as only winter visitants in California, and
there residing only on the dry interior plains, as far south as San Diego,
where they remain in large flocks until April. He has never met with
this bird during the summer months, though some are supposed to remain
and breed in the high prairies. He did not meet with any about the summits
of the Sierra Nevada, in September. They appeared to prefer the dry
rolling prairies to marshes, though they were occasionally found in the
latter.</p>

<p>This species is also a migratory visitant to the Department of Vera Cruz,
Mexico, where they are said by Sumichrast to pass the winter.</p>

<p>Their nests are built upon the ground, and are composed almost entirely
of the dry stems of grasses, and are lined with finer materials of the same.
Their eggs measure .75 of an inch in length by .52 in breadth, have a
greenish-white ground, over which are distributed numerous markings, spots,
and blotches of various sizes, of a light purplish-brown and a deeper red-brown,
confluent about the larger end, where they form a crown.</p>

<p>Near Fort Anderson nests were found in great numbers, no less than two
hundred and four having been obtained during four summers in that locality.
These nests were all taken on the ground, under low grass, in dry spots in
a large marshy prairie, and it is stated that they were never found in any
other situation or locality.</p>

Specimens of this race from Sitka are absolutely undistinguishable from
eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. savanna</i> except in size; the colors and proportion of bill being
the same. A young bird (from Kodiak) differs from that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">savanna</i> in

yellowish-fulvous tinge on jugulum and along the sides.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This variety is the northwest-coast form of the common Savanna
Sparrow, and is found during the summer from Oregon to Alaska. Dr.
Suckley states that he found this species an abundant spring visitor at Fort
Steilacoom. Dr. Cooper, in his Zoology of Washington Territory, states it to
be only a passenger through that section, migrating northward, at the end of
April, in pairs, and not returning until the end of September. They come
back in flocks, and frequent the shores and prairies along the sea-coast. Their
plumage seems to be the same at all seasons. Nothing is known of their
note. They are supposed to spend their winters in Southern Oregon and
California, though their actual presence has not been detected in either State.
They do not remain during the summer near the Columbia, but pass to the
north, or to the interior plains east of the Cascade Range. Dr. Cooper states
that their habits closely resemble those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. anthinus</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Dall states that two specimens of this species were taken at Sitka by
Mr. Bischoff.</p>

<p>This is the most strongly marked of the several races of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. savanna</i>, differing
from all the others in several important respects. The markings beneath
are more generally dispersed, extending back upon the lower part of
the breast, and forward over the throat; the lower tail-coverts have distinct
medial blackish streaks, though they are somewhat concealed. The median
stripe on the crown is decidedly greenish-yellow, not pale ashy; the whitish
edges to the interscapular feathers, so conspicuous in the other races, are more
concealed, presenting a more uniformly brown surface above, with broader
<!--615.png--><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 540]</span>
black stripes. The broad lateral stripes of the crown are deep olive or hair-brown,
with narrow, sharply defined, intense black streaks, instead of pale
grayish as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alaudinus</i> (spring dress), or light brown as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">savanna</i> (spring),
with broader, less deep, black streaks.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Shore Sparrow of California is said to be, to a remarkable
degree, the peculiar marsh species of the Pacific coast of that State. Dr.
Cooper states that he very rarely met with these birds out of the salt marshes,
where they lie so close and run so stealthily among the weeds that they are
flushed with difficulty. They rise only to fly a few rods, and drop again
into their covert. They are not at all gregarious, except when migrating, and
are found singly or by pairs. They are abundant about San Francisco in the
winter, though Dr. Cooper is not sure that any are found so far south in the
summer. Near San Diego, in February, they had already begun to utter
their short and pleasant song, as they perched on the top of some tall weed.
Dr. Cooper observed them in that neighborhood into April, but did not
succeed in finding any of their nests, nor was he ever able to meet with this
species at San Pedro in summer.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues speaks of (Ibis, 1866, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 268) finding three species of the difficult
group of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerculi</i>, and all of them very abundant, in Southern California
in November. These were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. rostratus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. alaudinus</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. anthinus</i>.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anthinus</i> seemed confined to the moist salt grass and sedgy weeds of the
sea-shore itself. It was flushed with great difficulty, and then its flight was
very rapid and irregular. It would alight again almost immediately, and run
with great celerity among the roots of the thick grasses, and was therefore
exceedingly difficult to procure. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. alaudinus</i> was common two or three
miles away from the coast, but Dr. Coues did not find one mixing with
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. anthinus</i>. It was a brush and weed, rather than a grass, species, associating
with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthus ludovicianus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zonotrichia coronata</i>.</p>

<p>The specimens described above were at first supposed to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centronyx
bairdi</i>, having several points of resemblance to that species, a comparison
with the type in Professor Baird’s collection at first failing to establish a difference,
as it was in faded and much worn summer plumage, while the Massachusetts
specimens were in perfect, blended fall dress, so that a satisfactory
comparison was almost impossible. A more recent examination, however,
with the advantage of two additional specimens of the Massachusetts bird, has
fully convinced Mr. Maynard that his specimens are not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centronyx bairdi</i>,
and that, indeed, they are referrible in all respects to the genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerculus</i>.</p>

<p>In carefully examining the type of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centronyx bairdi</i>, it is seen that its
characteristic features are the following: Outstretched feet reaching beyond
the end of the tail; hind claw as long as its digit, and much curved;&mdash;whereas
in Mr. Maynard’s specimens the outstretched feet reach to only about the
middle of the tail, while the hind claw is much shorter than its digit, and
only slightly curved. With a wing .10 to .45 of an inch longer, they have the
tarsus not any longer, and proportionally more slender. In coloration they are
still more different. The most striking feature in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. bairdi</i> is a broad and
very conspicuous median stripe of ochraceous-buff on the crown, bordered on
each side by an aggregation of black streaks, which form the predominating
color of the lateral stripes; of this median stripe there is scarcely any trace
in the specimens under consideration, while the crown generally is grayish-brown,
with small dusky streaks; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. bairdi</i> has broad, conspicuous, black
stripes on the back, while <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. princeps</i> has obsolete sandy-brown ones; in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. bairdi</i> there are only a few small streaks of black across the jugulum
and along the sides and flanks, while in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. princeps</i> the whole breast, as
well as the sides and flanks, are thickly streaked with broader marks of
sandy-brown.</p>

<p>In point of coloration, as well as in the feet, there is in reality a much
closer resemblance to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerculus rostratus</i>; but in this the very different
bill and different arrangement of markings are sufficient distinctive characters.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, therefore, there can be little doubt that the present birds
are well entitled to the name which Mr. Maynard has given them; for after
<!--617.png--><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 542]</span>
making all possible allowance for seasonal differences in coloration, we have
found it impossible to reconcile them with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. bairdi</i>.</p>

<p>In this species there is a slight superficial resemblance to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poocætes gramineus</i>;
but upon comparison it will be found to be entirely different: thus,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. gramineus</i> lacks the median light stripe on the crown, has the lesser wing-coverts
rufous and the lateral tail-feathers white, while the streaks are all
blackish and the ground-color different; the generic details, too, are quite
different.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species has been obtained only in Eastern Massachusetts,
where, in the neighborhood of Ipswich, it was found among the sand-hills by
the sea-shore. The place where the individuals taken were met with is a
rather remarkable tract, three miles in length and nearly one in breadth. It
is as treeless as the Great Plains, and as bleak and barren, with no vegetation
except a scant growth of coarse grass. Mr. Maynard obtained his first specimen
early in December, 1868. Although others were seen, yet this was all
he was then able to obtain. He has since taken others in the same place
and season. Nothing is known as to its habits. It uttered, as it rose, a short
chirp of alarm.</p>

Bill very long (.55 of an inch above). Whole upper parts and sides of
head and neck pale brownish-gray (almost fulvous), nearly every feather with a darker
central blotch, darkest along the shaft. A scarcely appreciable central stripe in the
crown, an obscure yellowish-white superciliary, and a whitish maxillary one. Under
parts pure white; streaked on the breast and the sides of throat and body with dark
brown (the streak paler externally). Under tail-coverts unspotted white. Tail and
wing feathers and wings margined with the color of the back; the edges of tertiaries
rather paler. Length, 5.30; wing, 2.90; tail, 2.30.</p>

Coast of California, south to Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas; mouth of Colorado River (<span class="sc">Dr.

<p>The bill of this species is very long and conical, the cutting edge nearly
straight. The wings are rather long, the tertiaries nearly as long in the
closed wing as the primaries; the second, third, and fourth quills longest,
the first rather longer than the fifth. The tail is short and emarginate, the
feathers narrow, acute, and moderately stiff. The tarsi are long; the claws
little curved.</p>

<p>This species resembles the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerculus savanna</i> rather more than any of
the other sparrows with spotted breasts; the bill is, however, very much
longer and larger, exceeding any of our American species of its size, the
upper outline more convex. Its colors are much paler, and it lacks the
<!--618.png--><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 543]</span>
yellow on the head and wing. The much shorter tail and entire absence of
rufous distinguish it from the spotted <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melospizas</i>. In shape the bill is like
that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ammodromus caudacutus</i>, but it is larger; the head lacks the yellow,
etc.</p>

<p>In some specimens the streaks on the back are almost obsolete.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> So far as is known, this bird seems to have a somewhat restricted
habitat, being apparently confined to the sea-coast of Southern California.
There it was first met with by Dr. Heermann, in the neighborhood of San
Diego, and was described by Mr. Cassin as an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ammodromus</i>, with which
genus of birds it seemed to have many peculiarities in common. Dr. Heermann
first met with this bird in 1851, on the shores of the bay of San Diego,
in company with other species, apparently in search of grass-seed. Afterwards,
in the Pacific Railroad Survey, with Lieutenant Williamson, he again
met with these birds in considerable numbers at Santa Barbara and San Pedro.
In all the places in which he met with it he found it frequenting low
sandy beaches, and the heavy sedge-grass which abounds on the shores. On
the former it seemed to be feeding on marine insects and seeds thrown up
by the tide, and in the latter to find places for easy and immediate concealment
when alarmed or pursued. Naturally it appeared to be a quiet and
unsuspicious bird. He heard it utter no other note than a short sharp chirp.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper thinks this species has a much greater affinity to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ammodrami</i>
than to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerculi</i>, both in its bill and claws, as well as in its
habits. He found them very abundant, both at San Pedro and San Diego,
at all seasons, and he does not think that they migrate at all from those
localities. He found them frequenting the shores of the bays and the sea-beaches.
They also came confidently and familiarly about the buildings near
the water, feeding on any seeds or insects they could find. On the beach
they run along the sand, in the rows of drifted sea-weeds, seeking their
food, and rarely take to flight unless surprised, and then only fly a short
distance. Dr. Cooper has never known them to alight on any bush, nor does
he think that they have any song. The only note he has ever heard them
utter is a short chirp. At San Pedro he saw them, in July, feeding their
young, but he has never found a nest that he was certain belonged to this
species.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found this bird abundant in Southern California, where it kept
among the thick weeds of the dry plain, and was much on the ground, where
it ran as easily as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilo</i>, often flying up into the bushes and resting there
quietly. They were to be seen also in great numbers sunning themselves
and catching flies on the piles of lumber on the wharf, so tame as to be almost
liable to be struck by a cane.</p>

<p>It is a winter resident at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, where Mr. Xantus found them
abundant. They were not seen there in summer, though it is probable they
reside on the shores in its neighborhood. Their nest and eggs remain
unknown.</p>

Above plumbeous-gray; the feathers of the back with dusky centres and
paler edges; the top of head also streaked with dusky and with an almost inappreciable
median stripe of lighter. Upper tail-coverts slightly darker in the centre. No rufous

<p>This bird, of which a single specimen only is so far known, is very closely
related to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. rostratus</i>, though very easily distinguished from it. It is considerably
smaller than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rostratus</i>, the bill more slender, the upper parts much
darker, being plumbeous, not sandy-colored; the stripes beneath darker; the
bill and legs more dusky. These differences may not indicate a distinct
species, but as the specimen here described differs entirely from all the specimens
of a large number of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. rostratus</i>, it is yet entitled to consideration as
a marked variety,&mdash;probably the resident race at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, where the
<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rostratus</i> is merely a winter visitor.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas Finch is a new species, in regard to the habits
of which nothing whatever is as yet known. It was obtained at San José,
in Lower California, by Mr. John Xantus, in December, 1859. It was found
in company with a flock of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerculus rostratus</i>, and the presumption is that
its habits may resemble those of that little-known species.</p>

a little longer than the inner, its claw reaching to the concealed base of the middle claw;
hind toe reaching to the middle of the middle claw. Wings unusually long, reaching to
the middle of the tail as far as the coverts, and pointed; the primaries considerably longer
than the secondaries, which are not much surpassed by the tertiaries; second and third
quills longest; first little shorter, about equal to the fourth, shorter than the tail; the outer
feathers scarcely shorter; the feathers rather stiff; each one acuminate and sharply pointed;
the feathers broad nearly to the end, when they are obliquely truncate. Streaked

longer than the tail and without long tertials; and the rather stiff, forked
tail, with its acute feathers. But one species is recognized at present.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Bay-winged or Grass Finch is a very abundant species
wherever found, and has a very extended
distribution. Accepting as
one species the slightly variant
races above indicated, this bird
extends from Florida and Mexico,
on the south, to the 57th parallel
of latitude, and from the eastern to
the western shores. It was found by
Richardson frequenting the plains
of the Saskatchewan, where it arrives
early in May and leaves in
September, and where it nests
abundantly in the short withered grass of that sterile region. Richardson
did not trace it farther north than the 57th parallel, and it was not obtained
on the Yukon or Anderson Rivers by Mr. MacFarlane or Mr. Lockhart. It
breeds from Northern Virginia north.</p>

<p>In the Middle States it is partially resident, a portion remaining all the
winter. South of Washington it is chiefly migratory, only found, in any
numbers, from November to March, and probably but few remaining to breed.
Audubon states that he never saw any of this species in any portion of Louisiana,
Missouri, Kentucky, or Ohio. Mr. Dresser, on the other hand, found
them common about San Antonio in August and September, and also in May
and June, and had no doubt that some remain to breed.</p>

<p>It is very abundant throughout New England, arriving in some seasons as
early as March 11, and remaining until quite late in the fall, often through
November. It is found chiefly in dry open fields and pastures, where it
nests, with no pains at concealment, on the ground, in depressions made by
its own work. It is an unsuspicious and fearless species, neither seeking
nor avoiding the companionship of man. It does not usually build near
houses, yet is not unfrequently known to do so. It may be often found
perched on fences along the roadside, chanting its simple and pleasing lay,
and quite as frequently in the road feeding and dusting itself. The latter
operation it is very fond of practising, and almost any day in the summer
these birds may be found in such situations.</p>

<p>West of the Great Plains is found a marked variety of this species, differing
in many respects from the eastern. The western species or race of this
Finch, Mr. Ridgway states, is an abundant summer bird in all the elevated
<!--624.png--><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 547]</span>
grassy portions of the West. It is especially characteristic of the higher
grassy slopes of the elevated mountains, particularly in the Rocky Mountain
regions, and its sweet and simple song is one of the pleasant associations of
those regions. It descends, in the autumn, to the lower districts, having been
observed during September in the greatest abundance among the “rye-grass”
meadows of Senot Valley, at the northern end of the East Humboldt Range.
It nests on the ground in grassy banks, in various situations.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley found this bird abundant on the Nisqually Plains, about
Puget Sound; and Dr. Cooper says it is common, in summer, on the prairies
of the interior of Washington Territory. Dr. Cooper also found it wintering
in the Colorado Valley, in considerable numbers, but all disappeared in
April. He thinks they breed in Northern California, though he has never
found them doing so. Dr. Newberry states that they are common in the
Sacramento Valley, both in the summer and in the fall. It was found by
Mr. Boucard, in winter, near Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>

<p>Their song is a very simple and pleasant succession of soft notes, resembling
that of the Canary, but thinner and feebler. It is begun early in the
morning and continued a few hours, and then renewed at sunset and kept up
often until after dark. It is also not unlike the song of the Song Sparrow,
but is neither so varied nor so loud and strong. It continues to sing until
late in the season.</p>

<p>They feed in the road, eating insects, seeds, and grain. They are fond of
searching also in ploughed fields, and keep principally upon the ground, exclusively
so when they are searching for their food.</p>

<p>Although as unsuspicious as the Song Sparrow or the Chipping Sparrow,
this Finch rarely, like them, comes about the house for crumbs of bread, but
seems to prefer to forage for itself in the fields and by the roadside. Taken
from the nest, these birds may be readily tamed, and soon become very interesting
and familiar little pets, though Nuttall states that where several
are thus kept they become very jealous of each other, and quarrelsome.</p>

<p>Their nest is always placed upon the ground, and is very simply constructed
of dry stems of grasses, with no other lining than soft fine materials
of the same. They have two, and sometimes three, broods in a season.
When their nest is approached, they make use of various artifices to draw
away the intruder, and often vary their devices in a very striking manner.
In May, 1836, crossing a field within a few rods of my home in Roxbury, I
nearly stepped upon a female sitting upon her nest. She immediately tumbled
forward towards me, counterfeiting the most extraordinary lameness,
so much so that I supposed that I had really stepped upon and severely
injured her. I stooped to pick up what I supposed to be a wounded bird,
and found her nest and four eggs. Visiting her nest again, as I approached
she flew from it quietly and silently, and immediately began the same manœuvres,
at some little distance from her nest, which she discontinued as
soon as she noticed that I was examining her treasures. These devices she
<!--625.png--><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 548]</span>
varied several times in a very remarkable manner. In Massachusetts I have
known this species to have its complement of eggs by the 15th of April.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are usually five, often four, and rarely six in
number. They are of an oblong-oval shape, the smaller end but slightly
more pointed than the other. They vary greatly in size, ranging from .90 to
.80 of an inch in length, and averaging about .65 in breadth. Their ground-color
is a pale greenish-white, marked with spots, lines, dots, and blotches
of various shades of reddish and purplish brown. In some eggs the spots
are few and small, chiefly confluent in a ring about the larger end, while the
ground-color is very plainly distinguishable. In others the ground is nearly
concealed by the abundance of the spots.</p>

Bill very large and stout, (except in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. lecontei</i>); the under mandible
broader, but lower than the upper, which is decidedly
convex at the basal portion of its upper
outline. Legs moderate, apparently not reaching
to the end of the tail. The tarsus appreciably
longer than the middle toe; the lateral toes equal,
and with their claws falling decidedly short of the
middle claw; the hind toe intermediate between
the two. The wings are short and rounded,
reaching to the base of the tail; the tertiaries
almost as long as the primaries; not much difference
in length in the primaries, although the
outer three or four are slightly graduated. The
tail is short and narrow, shorter than the wing
(except in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. lecontei</i>), graduated laterally, but slightly emarginate; the feathers all lanceolate
and acute, but not stiffened, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ammodromus</i>.</p>

<p>This genus agrees with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerculus</i> in the short and narrow tail. The
wings are much shorter and more rounded; the feet shorter, especially the
middle toe, which is not as long as the tarsus. The tail-feathers are more
lanceolate. The bill is much larger, and more swollen at the base.</p>

<p>The essential characters of this genus consist in the swollen convex bill;
the short toes, compared with the tarsus; the short and rounded wings; and

Upper parts yellowish-brown, the hood, neck, and upper parts of back
tinged with greenish-yellow. Interscapular feathers
dark brown, suffused externally with bright brownish-red;
each feather with grayish borders. Tertiaries,
rump, and tail-feathers abruptly dark chestnut-brown,
darkest centrally, paler externally, and narrowly margined
with gray. Crown with a broad black spotted
stripe on each side; these spots continued down to the
back. Two narrow black mandibular stripes and one
post-ocular on each side of the head, and an obscure
black crescent or spot behind the auriculars. Under
parts light brownish-yellow, paler on the throat and
abdomen. The jugulum, upper part of the breast, and
the sides of the body, conspicuously streaked with
black. Edge of wing yellow. A strong tinge of
pale chestnut on the wings and tail. The median
tail-feathers and upper coverts chestnut or rufous
brown, with sharply defined shaft-streaks of black. Length, 5.25; wing, 2.15; tail, 2.15.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern United States as far north as Massachusetts; westward to the Loup
Fork of Platte.</p>

<p>This species is related to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. passerinus</i>, but readily distinguished by the
well-marked stripes on breast and sides, the greenish-yellow, not chestnut-brown,
of head and nape, and the two mandibular dusky stripes. The middle
tail-feathers are reddish with only a very narrow sharply defined median
shaft-streak of black, instead of having the greater portion of the centre
dusky with scalloped edges. I have not seen young birds, but they probably
differ little from the adults.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The history and general distribution of Henslow’s Bunting is
still somewhat imperfectly known. Mr. Audubon first met with it, in 1820,
in Kentucky, nearly opposite to Cincinnati. It was seen on the ground,
amongst the tall grass, and is said to have exhibited all the peculiarities of
this tribe. He was afterwards informed that this bird is abundant in the
State of New Jersey, and that it breeds there; and in evidence of this he
mentions receiving a specimen from Dr. Trudeau, obtained by that gentleman
himself. Mr. Audubon also mentions that both Dr. Bachman and he
have procured a great number in South Carolina, where they abound, in the
latter part of autumn, and where, also, a portion remain during the winter.
In Florida, Mr. Audubon again met with these birds in the winter. They
<!--628.png--><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 551]</span>
were in great numbers in all the pine barrens of that State, in light and
sandy soil, and in woods but thinly overgrown by tall pines. They never
alight on trees, but spend their time on the ground, running with great rapidity
through the grass, in the manner of a mouse.</p>

<p>In New Jersey they were found in ploughed fields, where they are presumed
to have been overlooked and mistaken for the Yellow-winged Sparrow.
Mr. Audubon supposed that they were not found farther eastward
than that State.</p>

<p>Specimens in the Smithsonian collection have been procured in Georgia
in December; in Maryland in July; at Fort Riley, Kansas, Southern Illinois,
and in Nebraska, in June.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts they are regular summer visitants, though as yet they
have been met with in only a few instances and in a somewhat restricted
locality. They are now met with nearly every year, and several nests have
been taken. Mr. Maynard obtained two specimens, May 10, in a wet
meadow in Newton. Their song-note he describes as like the syllables <i class="birdcall">see-wick</i>,
the first syllable prolonged, the latter given quickly. This bird was
first obtained in Berlin, in that State, by Mr. E. S. Wheeler, who discovered
its nest and eggs. It was mistaken for Bachman’s Finch, and was at first
so placed on the record, though the error was immediately corrected. Since
then, in that town, and in one or two others in its neighborhood, other nests
have been met with. Mr. William Brewster obtained several specimens in
Lexington, May 14, 1872. It is quite probable that it has been confounded
with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. passerinus</i>, and it is now supposed to be more common in the eastern
part of the State than that bird.</p>

<p>One specimen of this Bunting was taken near Washington, during the
summer season, from which circumstance Dr. Coues gives it as an exceedingly
rare summer resident of the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>In 1871, Mr. Ridgway ascertained that, so far from being rare, Henslow’s
Bunting is very abundant on the prairies of Southern Illinois, as well as the
Yellow-winged species, but far exceeding the latter in numbers. Though
entirely similar to that bird in habits and manners, it may be readily distinguished
by its note, which is said to be an abrupt <i class="birdcall">pil-lut</i>, much more like the
common summer-call of the Shore Lark than the lisped grasshopper-like
chirp of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. passerinus</i>, and to be uttered as the bird perches on the summit
of a tall weed, the tail being depressed, and the head thrown back at
each utterance. A number of unidentified eggs were sent to me several
years since, by Mr. Kennicott, from near Chicago. They resembled somewhat
the eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. passerinus</i>, but were not the eggs of that species. I
have now no doubt they belonged to this bird.</p>

<p>The nest is built in the ground, in a depression, or apparently an excavation
scratched out by the bird itself, and is a well-made structure of coarse,
dry, and soft reeds and grasses, well lined with finer materials of the same
description. The eggs, five or six in number, somewhat resemble those of
<!--629.png--><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 552]</span>
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. passerinus</i>. Their ground-color is a clear bright white, and they are
spotted with well-defined reddish-brown markings, and more subdued tints
of purple. The markings, so far as I have seen their eggs, are finer and
fewer than those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. passerinus</i>, and are distributed more exclusively around
the larger end. The eggs measure .78 by .60 of an inch, and are of a more
oblong-oval than those of the common Yellow-Wing.</p>

Bill much more slender than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. henslowi</i>. First quill the longest, the rest
diminishing rapidly. Tail emarginate and rounded, with the feathers acute. Upper parts
light yellowish-red, streaked with brownish-black; the margins of the feathers and
scapulars pale yellowish-white. Tail-feathers dusky, margined with light-yellowish.
Lower parts, with the cheeks and a broad band over the eyes, fine buff. Medial line
yellowish anteriorly, nearly white behind. The buff extending to the femorals and along
the sides, streaked with brownish-black. Throat, neck, and upper parts of the breast,
without any streaks, and plain buff. Length, 4.40; wing, 2.13; bill along ridge, .37;

Mouth of Yellowstone, to Texas.</p>

<p>Since the regret expressed in the Birds of North America (1858) at the
loss of the single specimen known of this species, another has been received
by the Smithsonian Institution from Washington <abbr title="County">Co.</abbr>, Texas, collected by
Dr. Lincecum. It is in very poor condition, having been skinned for an
alcoholic preparation, and does not admit of a satisfactory description of the
colors. In its unspotted breast, the rufous feathers of the hind neck, the
absence of maxillary stripes, and apparently in the markings of the wings, it
is most like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. passerinus</i>. Although the inner tail-feathers have the narrow
stripe of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">henslowi</i>, the bill is much smaller, as stated by Audubon, than in
the others, and is apparently bluish, not yellow. The vertical stripe is
deep buff anteriorly, and pale ashy posteriorly, instead of buff throughout,
and the superciliary stripe is continuously buff, instead of yellow anterior to,
and ashy behind, the eye. In the comparative length of wing and tail, it is
most nearly related to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">henslowi</i>, but the bill is very much narrower than in
either. Upon the whole, there can be no doubt of its actual specific distinctness
from both its allies.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Leconte’s Sharp-tailed Sparrow was procured by Audubon in
his expedition to the Yellowstone. He speaks of its having very curious
notes, which he describes as of a sharp, querulous nature, and a general habit
of keeping only among the long, slender green grasses that here and there
grew up in patches along the margins of the creeks. So closely did it keep
<!--630.png--><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 553]</span>
in the coverts to which it resorted, that it was very difficult to force it to
rise on the wing, when only it could be procured. Mr. Audubon did not
meet with its nest or young, and they remain unknown.</p>

<p>This type specimen was presented by Audubon to Professor Baird. A
second was sent to the Smithsonian Institution, from Texas, by Dr. <a id="chg14" name="chg14"></a>Lincecum.</p>

Feathers of the upper parts brownish-rufous or chestnut-brown, margined
narrowly and abruptly with ash-color; reddest on the lower part of the back and rump;
the feathers all abruptly black in the central portion; this color visible on the interscapular
region, where the rufous is more restricted. Crown blackish, with a central and superciliary
stripe of yellowish tinged with brown, brightest in front of the eye. Bend of the
wing bright yellow; lesser coverts tinged with greenish-yellow. Quills and tail-feathers
edged with whitish; tertiaries much variegated. Lower parts brownish-yellow or buff,
nearly white on the middle of the belly, darkest on the jugulum. The feathers of the
upper breast and sides of the body with obsoletely darker centres, these sometimes
wanting. Sides of breast against bend of wing with a few black streaks, usually concealed.
Length about 5 inches; wing, 2.40; tail, 2.00.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern United States; south to Guatemala; Jamaica, resident; Porto Rico.</p>

<p>The young of this species have the jugulum and sides of the breast
streaked with black, much more distinct than in the adult, and exhibiting a
slight resemblance to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. henslowi</i>. The upper parts are less varied.</p>

<p>Specimens from the Far West have the bill more slender, the reddish of the
back considerably paler, the dark markings of the back restricted, the light
stripe on the head with scarcely any yellow, a decided spot in front of the
eye quite yellow, and little or no ochraceous on the breast.</p>

<p>The young bird, with streaked jugulum, may be most readily distinguished
from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. henslowi</i> by the grayer plumage without any shade of chestnut or
greenish-yellow, the sparseness of streaks on the side, the absence of the
two mandibular dusky stripes, and the broad dusky centres of the middle
tail-feathers.</p>

<p>Quite a fine series of specimens from Jamaica and other West India Islands
affords ample material to judge of the validity of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. tixicrus</i> of
<!--631.png--><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 554]</span>
Gosse. It is scarcely possible to distinguish these Jamaican specimens from
examples from the Eastern Province of the United States, though minute
differences are observable. Their size is somewhat smaller, but they are resident
in the region where obtained; and the shades of color are just appreciably
darker. There are, however, no differences sufficient to justify retaining
the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tixicrus</i>, to designate even a variety.</p>

<p>All the specimens in the collection from Mexico and Guatemala are in
the autumnal or winter dress, so that it is probable that they are not resident
there; they appear to be identical with North American specimens, and
referrible to the variety <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">passerinus</i> as restricted.</p>

<p>Between summer and winter specimens great differences are observable;
in the former season the edges of the feathers become worn, so that often the
chestnut spots disappear entirely, while the other markings become poorly
defined, leaving the black blotches predominant.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Yellow-winged Sparrow appears to be a bird of
irregular and unequal distribution, found in certain localities in great abundance,
and not seen in the intervening districts. According to some writers,
it is partial to sandy places near the sea, and this is certainly true of the
neighborhood of New York City, and also of a large portion of the New
Jersey coast. It is likewise the case in certain portions of Eastern Massachusetts,
as, according to Mr. Maynard, this species is very numerous in
Nantucket, where it breeds abundantly. I have never met with this Sparrow
in Massachusetts, except in a single instance, near Boston, nor in any collections
of eggs have I seen any that I supposed could be those of this species;
yet in the western part of the State, according to Mr. Allen, it is an abundant
summer visitant, arriving there about the first week in May, and leaving
early in September, breeding in dry fields and pastures, and raising two
broods in a season. According to Mr. Boardman, it is an occasional visitant
in the neighborhood of Calais, yet rare; arriving there the first of April, five
weeks earlier than it shows itself in Springfield. Yet that this bird has
ever been met with between Boston and Calais does not appear. It was not
seen in Western Maine by Professor Verrill.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Hartford, <abbr title="Connecticut">Conn.</abbr>, this bird appears also to be a not uncommon
summer resident. In 1860, I received from Mr. T. S. Brandigee
several nests found in that neighborhood. They were all constructed on the
ground, in a field of thin grass, and their tops were all nearly covered over.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann states that he found this bird a not uncommon species, in
the summer season, near San Antonio; and Mr. Dresser also procured a specimen
there in the early summer. Dr. Lincecum mentions it as a common
resident in Washington County, in the same State. He describes it as a
close-hiding Grass Sparrow, running on the ground in the manner of a mouse,
and never seen to alight on trees. Dr. Coues speaks of it as a resident
species in South Carolina, especially abundant during the period of migration.</p>

<p><!--632.png--><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 555]</span>
It has been found quite common, during the winter months, in Central
America, specimens having been procured there by Señor Constancia, Mr.
Skinner, and Dr. Van Patten. It was also found at Oaxaca, Mexico, by Mr.
Boucard.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall and Mr. Audubon speak of it as occurring in Oregon, but Dr.
Cooper did not meet with it on the Pacific coast. Dr. Kennerly obtained a
single specimen on one of the forks of the Colorado, in February. Mr. Ridgway
met with the western form of this species, in suitable places, in the
Sacramento Valley and the Great Basin, and proposes for it the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perpallidus</i>.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Newark, <abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr>, I have found this species apparently one
of the most abundant in that neighborhood, having obtained there in the
month of June more eggs of this than of any other species.</p>

<p>In Northfield, <abbr title="Illinois">Ill.</abbr>, near the lake shore, Mr. Robert Kennicott met with
the nests of these birds in great abundance. From these facts I infer that
it is not necessarily or exclusively a bird of the sea-shore, but that in certain
favorable localities it is as abundant in the interior as on the coast, and
that at intervals it may be met with from Texas to Maine, and from the
Atlantic to the interior, nearly or quite to the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>In Jamaica, Mr. March states, this species is not uncommon in the savannas
and grass lands near Spanish Town. It is a resident in that island,
and breeds there in considerable numbers, nesting in tufts of grass-roots.
It is only common in certain localities.</p>

<p>I have never heard its note to know it. Wilson speaks of it as a short,
weak, interrupted chirp. According to Mr. Ridgway, it bears a close resemblance
to the note of a grasshopper. Nuttall says they sing in an agreeable
voice, something like that of the Purple Finch, though less vigorously; and
Audubon characterizes it as an unmusical ditty, composed of a few notes
weakly enunciated at intervals.</p>

<p>It is terrestrial in its habits, living, nesting, and feeding on or near the
ground. It subsists on larvæ, insects, and the seeds of grasses and small
weeds.</p>

<p>This bird builds its nest on the ground, usually in a small tuft of grass or
in a cluster of plants. It is made of dry grasses, and is lined with fine bent
and horsehair. The young are said to follow their parents for a short time,
but soon separate, and learn to take care of themselves. This species is not
gregarious, and is never seen in flocks, not even when just about to migrate.</p>

<p>Wilson and Nuttall describe the eggs as grayish-white, sprinkled with
brown. Audubon says they are dingy-white, sprinkled with brown spots.
This is not accurate. The ground-color is a clear crystalline white, beautifully
dashed and marbled with bold markings of an almost golden brown.
These spots vary in size, are often quite large, and occasionally make a
corona about the larger end. The eggs are of a rounded oval, almost spherical,
shape, measuring .75 by .63 of an inch.</p>

more intensified, and in greater contrast with the lighter ashy and olive

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Sharp-tailed Finch is one of the most striking and well-characterized
of land-birds, and as peculiar to the sea-shore as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tringæ</i>.
In habits it very closely resembles the whole family of Waders in many
striking respects. Like them it feeds upon small crustaceans and minute
marine insects, keeping about the water’s edge, walking upon the floating
weeds and other substances raised by the tide, preferring this mode of life
to a more inland residence, and only resorting to the uplands to feed upon
the seeds of grasses and sedges when their food fails them at the water’s
edge.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues is of the opinion that this bird does not breed in the neighborhood
of Beaufort, <abbr title="North Carolina">N. C.</abbr>, and that it leaves for the North in May, having
a more northern habitat than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. maritima</i>. He does not coincide with those
who detect a resemblance between the actions of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ammodrami</i> and of
the Sandpipers. He thinks the manner in which they climb the reeds, slide
up and down, and hang from them in various attitudes, is more like that
of Nuthatches and Titmice. On the ground they seem to him unmistakably
sparrow-like.</p>

<p>This Sharp-tailed Finch is abundant along the coasts of Connecticut and
Rhode Island, and is also found in Massachusetts, though sparingly, and only
in a few congenial localities. In the marshes of Charles River, near Boston,
this species is occasionally common in the breeding-season. In the summer
of 1869, Mr. H. W. Henshaw found quite a number of their nests. Mr.
Maynard has also taken it among the marshes of Ipswich, which is probably
about its extreme northern limit. It has not, so far as I am aware, been
traced to Maine. In these localities it probably raises two broods in a season,
as it appears there in May, and remains until into October. They are
eminently terrestrial, run on the ground like mice, are difficult to flush, and
can only be shot while on the wing. They lie close to the ground, and conceal
themselves in the grass.</p>

<p>They are also very numerous in the marshes in the neighborhood of New
York, and especially so in New Jersey, breeding along that coast to Cape
May. How much farther south than this they are found I cannot state, but
I did not meet with any at Cape Charles, where the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">maritimus</i> was very
abundant.</p>

<p>In the winter this species is found in large flocks along the shores of South
Carolina and Georgia. Mr. Audubon, however, did not find any in Florida.
In the marshes near Charleston they are found in immense flocks, so much
so that Audubon has known of forty being killed at a single shot. They
search in the sedgy marshes for their food when the tide is out, and, on the
approach of the returning waters, retreat to the higher shores and to the
rice embankments.</p>

<p><!--636.png--><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 559]</span>
The flight of this species is quite different from that of any other bird, and
by it they may at once be recognized. In flying, they also drop their tails
very low.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon states that during the winter the Sharp-tailed Finch is
furnished with an extra quantity of feathers on the rump, for which he finds
it difficult to account.</p>

<p>These birds are essentially maritime, are found only in the vicinity of the
sea, and always keep immediately about the water, except when the inclemency
of the weather drives them to the high grass of the uplands for shelter.
They walk and run, or remain feeding on the floating weeds and other substances
raised by the tide, with all the ease and fearlessness with which they
move on the land. They are gregarious in the winter, and in the Southern
marshes are found feeding in companies. During the breeding-season they
keep more in pairs, and are found more isolated. At this time they are also
shy, and difficult to detect. Their usual call-note is only a single <i class="birdcall">tweet</i>, and
in the love-season their series of twitters Mr. Audubon thinks hardly worthy
to be called a song. They feed indiscriminately on seeds, insects, small
crustaceans, and various forms of refuse matter floated or thrown up by the
tides.</p>

<p>On the coast of New Jersey, where these birds are found in the greatest
abundance, they have at least two broods in a season. Their nest is on the
ground, in a small tussock of grass or sedges, but little removed from the
reach of the tide, and is placed in a depression apparently excavated for the
purpose. They are loosely made of soft and slender grasses, arranged in a
circular form. The nest is large for the bird, spacious and deep, and is softly
lined with finer and similar materials.</p>

<p>Their eggs, five or six in number, are of a somewhat rounded oval shape,
having an average breadth of .59 of an inch, and vary in length from .78 to
.70. Their ground-color is a light green, occasionally a dull white, with
hardly a perceptible tinge of greenish, thickly sprinkled equally over the entire
egg, with fine rusty-brown dots. These are of various sizes, but all fine.
In a few the larger dots are confluent in a ring around the larger end; in
others, the finer dots are so small as to be only distinguishable under a glass,
concealing the ground-color, and giving to the egg an almost uniform rusty
color. These eggs vary but little in shape, and are nearly equally rounded
at either end, though never entirely so.</p>

of the fulvous superciliary stripe.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Atlantic sea-coast of United States, northward to Long Island Sound.</p>

<p>The same seasonal differences in coloration are observable in this species
as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. caudacutus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Seaside Finch has very nearly the same distribution, habits,
and manners of life, as the Sharp-tailed species, and the description of
these in one would answer almost equally well for the other. There are,
however, certain shades of difference in several respects to be observed.</p>

<p>This bird is, if anything, more southern in its distribution than the other,
and does not extend its visits in summer so far north. While the Sharp-tailed
Finch is not an uncommon bird on the shores of the New England
States, as far to the north as Ipswich, the Seaside Finch is comparatively
rare, much more so now than it was formerly. Mr. Maynard states that he
has searched carefully for it from the Merrimack to the extreme southern
shores of Massachusetts without finding any specimens, nor could he find
any on the island of Nantucket, a very natural and congenial locality. Dr.
Coues states that it is abundant on the New Hampshire coast, but recent
endeavors have failed to detect it. In 1836 and 1837 a few isolated pairs
built in the marshes of Stony Brook, near Boston, above tide-water, nesting
not on the ground, but in low bushes. They were identified by Mr. Audubon.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1852 I found this species very abundant on the low
sandy islands of Cape Charles, <abbr title="Virginia">Va.</abbr> There, in every instance, their nests
<!--638.png--><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 561]</span>
were in low bushes, about a foot from the ground. They were the only land-birds
found on these islands.</p>

<p>Rev. C. M. Jones informs me that at Madison, <abbr title="Connecticut">Conn.</abbr>, on the coast, the
Seaside and the Sharp-tailed Finches occur in about equal numbers in the
salt marshes. He was not able to observe any specific difference in their
mode of nesting, except that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">maritimus</i> seemed to be more common in
that part of the marsh nearest the shore, while the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caudacutus</i> was more
abundant farther back towards the highlands, though this was not the invariable
rule. He sometimes found the nests suspended in the salt grass, the
latter being interwoven with the other materials. In all such cases the entrance
was on the side of the nest, in the manner of the Marsh Wren. At
other times he found the nest placed under a quantity of lodged grass, but
resting on a portion still lower. In such cases it is generally open at the top.
He has also found them on the ground, and, when thus placed, always much
more bulky than when built as above, a considerable quantity of dead grass
being laid down to keep the nest above the wet, though not always with
success. On Cobb’s Island, <abbr title="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, Mr. Jones only found the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">maritimus</i>, the
nests of which were in bushes, from one foot to eighteen inches from the
ground.</p>

<p>The call-note of this species is said to be a monotonous chirp, and its song
hardly to deserve that name. The notes of which it is composed are few,
and have neither variety, emphasis, nor attractiveness.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues states that this Finch begins to sing when mating, and is afterwards,
during the incubating, particularly earnest and persevering about it.
Each pair usually claims some particular copse, and the male usually has his
favorite singing-post, to which it continually resorts. He adds that its
simple song is something like that of the Yellow-shouldered Sparrow, beginning
with a few slow notes, then a rapid trill, finally slurred, till it sounds
like the noise made by some of the grasshoppers.</p>

<p>These birds are at all times shy and difficult to be approached. When
their nest is visited, the parents leave it and secrete themselves, and cannot
be traced without great difficulty. When thus hidden, they will almost
suffer themselves to be trodden upon before they will fly up.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon thinks they have two broods, their first being hatched out
early in June. Their nests, he states, are usually placed next to the ground,
but not sunk in it. Their food consists of marine insects, small crabs, and
snails, as well as small sand-beetles and seeds. Their flesh has a rank, unsavory
flavor, so much so that, having had some made into a pie, he could
not eat it. He states also that they are resident in the Southern States, and
are found along the Gulf coast as far as Texas.</p>

<p>The nest is strongly but coarsely woven of dry sedges, stems, and grasses,
and is lined with similar but finer materials. The eggs are five in number,
have a grayish-white ground, and are spotted and blotched with reddish-brown.
The blotches are distributed over the entire egg, and are much
<!--639.png--><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 562]</span>
larger than in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caudacutus</i>. There is, indeed, no similarity between the
two eggs. They measure .88 by .68 of an inch.</p>

<p>The young bird has the breast and
throat with a good many spots of dark
brown instead of the single large one
on the breast. The other markings are
more obscure.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Lark Finch is found
from Eastern Illinois to the Pacific, and
from Oregon to Texas. Within this wide
area of distribution it is everywhere
abundant in the open prairies and
plains. It is not found in wooded regions.
This bird was described by Say,
and was first met with by Long’s expedition
to the Missouri River. It was not known to either Wilson or Audubon,
and its habits were very imperfectly known to Nuttall.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found this bird very abundant in Texas throughout the summer,
arriving in the neighborhood of San Antonio in March, and leaving
there early in October. He found their nests quite common, and usually
built in a mesquite tree or bush, of fine roots and grasses. Dr. Heermann
also found it abundant in New Mexico. In Arizona, Dr. Coues found it,
chiefly in spring and autumn, a migrant, and, at those seasons, very numerous.
Many remain during the summer to breed, and a few are found in the
winter. It was met with near New Leon, Mexico, by Lieutenant Couch, but
was not obtained in Vera Cruz by Sumichrast. It was taken near Oaxaca,
Mexico, by Mr. Boucard. A single specimen was obtained at Fort Dalles in
Oregon, by Dr. Suckley, but it was not met with by him west of the Cascade
Mountains. Mr. Townsend states that he also found it in that region.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper did not find this species in the Colorado Valley, though it has
been obtained at Fort Yuma in December; and, as he has met with them in
large flocks in the valleys of San Diego in February, he concludes that they
winter in the southern part of California. They breed from San Diego
throughout California, and as far north as the Columbia, where they arrive
early in May. Dr. Cooper has never found their nest in California, but
has frequently met with it in Kansas and Nebraska in May and June.
He found them on the ground, and their nests were constructed chiefly of
grass.</p>

<p>He speaks of them as singing very sweetly, and states that in their song
they resemble the Canary more than any other bird. They frequent the
open plains, usually in the neighborhood of trees, upon which they often
<!--641.png--><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 564]</span>
alight in flocks. Their food consists of the seeds of grass and other small
plants, which they collect on the ground.</p>

<p>A single specimen of this bird was shot in Massachusetts in 1845, by Mr.
Samuel Jillson. It was taken in Gloucester, on the coast, where its appearance
was, of course, purely accidental.</p>

<p>We are indebted to the careful observations of Mr. Ridgway for the principal
portion of our knowledge of the manners and mode of life of this
species, which he has recently ascertained to be an abundant summer resident
in Southern Illinois. It is probably equally abundant throughout the
State, and is found as far east as Ohio, where it becomes rare.</p>

<p>The Prairie Lark-Finch was found by that accurate observer very abundant
at Sacramento, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, where it frequented alike the oak groves, the cottonwood
and willow copses, and the weedy fields and meadows. At Sacramento it was
eminently arboreal, quite in contrast with its habits as observed in Illinois. It
was also met with in the interior, wherever the locality was suited to it. Near
Salt Lake City it is one of the most numerous of the birds inhabiting the
artemisia grounds, in the outskirts of the town, in company with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poospiza
bilineata</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spizella breweri</i>. It is called by the Utah boys the Snake-Bird,
from the supposed resemblance of its striped head to that of a snake. At
Sacramento it is greatly prized as a cage-bird, and young birds readily sell
there for four dollars a pair. He states that the delightful song of this bird
has no parallel among the North American <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fringillidæ</i>, and claims that in
this respect it is pre-eminently superior to that of all the other members of
this family. As it perches upon the summit of a small tree, on the telegraph
wire, or upon a fence, its notes may be heard throughout the day, in the
morning before those of any others, and late in the evening, when all except
for this irrepressible songster is silence.</p>

<p>The song of this species is described as composed of regularly divided
parts, almost perfect in compass, in vigor and continuity unsurpassed, if not
unequalled, by any other North American species. It begins with a series
of chants, the style reminding one somewhat of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanospiza cyanea</i>, but
each syllable loud, rich, and clear, and uttered with a peculiar emotional trill,
the whole seemingly delivered in a hurried manner, in one continuous gush
of sprightly silvery notes, each accompanied by a metallic <i class="birdcall">tremolo</i>. As if
exhausted, the singer falters, and the notes become scarcely audible, then
suddenly reviving, as if in great joy, the song is resumed in all its vivacity,
until the bird at last really appears to be overcome by its efforts.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues met with this species in Arizona in the winter. He writes me
as follows: “The most eastern point where I observed this species was at
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, Mo. I saw a good many in the suburbs of that city in May, 1865.
It is one of the most abundant Sparrows about Fort Whipple, particularly
during the migrations; the majority pass northward in April and May, but
many breed in the vicinity, and some pass the winter in sheltered situations.
It is generally seen in companies, frequenting the skirts of woods, the underbrush
<!--642.png--><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 565]</span>
along mountain rivulets, and similar situations, where the seeds of
various plants are procurable; its general habits resemble those of the species
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zonotrichia</i>.”</p>

<p>The nests were found by Mr. Ridgway in various situations; the larger
number were upon the ground, but several were in trees varying in height
from six to twenty feet from the ground. They were found from the latter
part of May through June. A nest obtained in Southern Wisconsin by Mr.
Thure Kumlien is very homogeneous in structure, consisting entirely of
loosely intertwined stems of dry grasses, sedges, and carices. It was built
on the ground, is nearly flat, and has only a very shallow cavity. Its entire
height is less than two inches, and the depth of its depression not half an
inch. The diameter of the nest is three and a half inches, and that of the
cavity at the rim three inches.</p>

<p>The maximum number of their eggs is five. Their average measurement
is .85 by .65 of an inch. The ground-color is usually a grayish-white,
rarely a light brown, marbled and streaked with waving lines, and a few dots
of black or a blackish-brown.</p>

<p>The character distinguishing the western representative (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. gambeli</i>) of

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The White-crowned Sparrow is found from the Rocky Mountains
eastward to the Atlantic, and in all the intervening territory, from the
Southern States to the Arctic regions. In the high meadows of the
Wahsatch Mountains, Mr. Ridgway found this bird very abundant, and one
very characteristic, breeding there quite as numerously as any other species.
In all that region Mr. Ridgway did not meet with a single individual of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z.
gambeli</i>, its western representative. At the encampment at Parley’s Park
these birds soon became on very familiar terms with the party. They were
very sociable, and paid frequent visits to the cook’s tent, and picked up, without
the slightest signs of fear, the crumbs from the ground. Their sweet
morning carol was, he states, delightful to the ear, and they were held in
great favor by all. A nest of these birds was found on the ground, at Parley’s
Park, June 26. It was built in a bunch of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Geranium</i>. Specimens of this
species were obtained, in winter, at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, Lower California, by Mr.
Xantus.</p>

<p>Although an eastern species, passing, in its migrations, through the Southern
Atlantic States to Labrador in the spring and returning in the fall, it is
a rare species in all New England. Mr. Boardman says that it is not common
in Eastern Maine, and Mr. Verrill that it is rare in the western part of
that State. In Eastern Massachusetts it is very rare. Mr. Maynard mentions
obtaining a single specimen, May 27, and regards it as quite a rare
migrant. I have never met with the bird near Boston, and do not believe
that it is found there, except singly and rarely. In the western part of the
State, though less rare, it is very far from being common. It is found there
in the spring, from the 20th to the 30th of May, and in October from the 1st

to the 15th. Mr. Allen met with it from May 7 to June 6, in 1861, when
these birds were more common than usual. At this period, farther west, in
Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, and New York, these birds are very abundant.
From April 10 to the latter portion of May, in 1852, they were abundant in
the neighborhood of Washington, the Capitol grounds being full of them.
They were familiar and fearless, and seemed to delight to search for food
under the large Norway spruces, branching down to the ground. Their
abundance that spring may have been exceptional, as Wilson appears to have
met with but very few specimens.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon found these Sparrows very abundant in Labrador, where
they were apparently late in breeding. It was not until the 6th of July that
he found one of their nests. This was placed among the moss at the foot of
a low fir. It was made externally of dry hypnum mosses, matted in bunches
like the coarse hair of some quadruped, and internally of fine dry grasses,
arranged with great neatness, to the thickness of half an inch, with a full
lining of the delicate yellow fibrous roots of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coptis trifolia</i>. The nest
was five inches in its external diameter, and two in depth, the cavity two and
a quarter wide and one and three quarters deep. The eggs, five in number,
he describes as of a light sea-green color, mottled towards the larger end
with brownish spots and blotches, a few spots of a lighter tint being dispersed
over the whole. All the nests found were placed on the ground or
among the moss, and all were alike in their construction. By the beginning
of August the party met with young that were able to fly. By the middle
of that month they had commenced their southern migrations.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues also found this Sparrow breeding in great numbers along the
entire coast of Labrador. Found in all situations, it seemed to be particularly
fond of deep, thickly wooded, and secluded ravines, surrounded by high
precipitous cliffs, and, when in more open districts, confining itself to tangled
patches of juniper and scrubby firs. He describes it as a very active
and sprightly bird, almost continually in motion. It seldom alights without
rapidly jerking and flirting its tail, and uttering its loud chirpings. While
the female is incubating, the male usually mounts to the top of the cliff or a
neighboring tree, and repeats his loud and not unpleasing, though somewhat
monotonous, notes for the space of half an hour or more. He describes its
song as very similar to that of the White-throated Sparrow, consisting of
two long-drawn syllables with a rising intonation, then three more in a quick,
hurried manner, with a falling cadence,&mdash;<i class="birdcall">pēé-dēé-dē-dē-dē</i>; the whole is
delivered in a mellow whistle. If approached while thus engaged, the performer
becomes instantly silent, and dives hastily into the nearest cover.
The nest was always placed on the ground, and usually in little patches of
low heath, abundant wherever the ground was dry. He found a nest on the
<abbr title="twenty-third">23d</abbr> of July, containing young just hatched. The female flutters off in
silence when her nest is disturbed, but the male bird vociferates his angry
remonstrance, flirting his tail and jerking his body in an energetic manner.</p>

<p><!--646.png--><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 569]</span>
The food of this bird, in Labrador, was found to consist of small coleopterous
insects, grass-seeds, a variety of berries, as well as minute shell-fish,
for which they searched the margins of ponds near the sea-shore. They
were also seen to pursue insects on the wing. Mr. Audubon speaks of its
song as consisting of six or seven notes, and describes it as loud, clear, and
musical, although of a plaintive nature, diminishing in power to the last note.
Its flight he describes as low, swift, and protracted.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues did not find this bird abundant in South Carolina during the
winter, and conjectures that it does not go so far to the south. Its migrations
do not appear to be well defined, and nowhere is it known to be abundant
during this season. Lieutenant Couch met with it at Brownville, Texas, and
Tamaulipes, Mexico, and at Charco Escondido, in March, at which time they
were in flocks, indicating a more southern migration than is generally supposed.</p>

<p>It extends its northern migrations to the extreme northern and northeastern
portions of the continent, and also to Greenland. On the Yukon and
Anderson Rivers it is replaced by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. gambeli</i>. It is not abundant in
Greenland. Holböll obtained a single specimen only in August; and afterwards
met with a flock of young birds. He infers that they breed in the
interior, but are restricted to a very narrow strip of territory.</p>

<p>Eggs of this species, from Wyoming Territory, measure from .90 to .95 of
an inch in length by .70 in breadth, and are of an oblong-oval shape. The
ground-color is a light greenish-white, thickly marked with reddish-brown
and lighter markings of an obscure purplish-brown. The intensity, depth of
coloring, and size of the darker brown markings, vary. They are principally
disposed about the larger end.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Specific Characters"><span class="sc">Sp. Char.</span></abbr>
Precisely similar to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. leucophrys</i>, but rather smaller; the lores are gray
throughout, this color continuous with a white superciliary stripe along the side of the
head. Length, 6.25; wing, 2.83; tail, 3.08.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Rocky Mountains to the Pacific coast, north to Nulato and Fort Kenai, east
through the valley of the Mackenzie River, and south to Jalisco and Mazatlan, Mexico.</p>

<p>As stated in the previous article, the only appreciable and constant difference
between this race and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. leucophrys</i> is found in the character of the
black stripe on the side of the crown. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">leucophrys</i> the black passes down
<!--647.png--><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 570]</span>
over the upper half of the lores, and in front of the eye, to a line continuous
with the cutting edge of the bill, and sends back a short branch to the eye,
which cuts off the white superciliary stripe. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gambeli</i> the superciliary
stripe passes continuously forward to the ashy lores, cutting off the black from
the eye. The lower edge of the black anteriorly is much higher than in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">leucophrys</i>, and nearly on a line with the nostrils.</p>

<p>We cannot give any positive character by which immature specimens of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">leucophrys</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gambeli</i> may be distinguished, unless that the short dark line
from forehead to eye of the former is indicated by a greater amount of dusky
at the base of the feathers of that region.</p>

<p>The young of this species, like that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">leucophrys</i>, is streaked with blackish
on side of the throat, across the breast, and on the sides of body, instead
of being entirely unmarked beneath, as in the adult.</p>

<p>One specimen, collected in the West Humboldt Mountains, connects this
form with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">leucophrys</i>, and may possibly be a hybrid. In this there is a
black spot in front of the eye, but separated from the black of the crown by
the usual light superciliary stripe of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gambeli</i>.</p>

<p>Some specimens from the coast region of California have the ash of head
and breast duller, and with a brownish cast, and the spots on the back black
instead of deep dark brown.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Western White-crowned Sparrow is found in great abundance,
from Mexico to the Arctic Ocean, between the Rocky Mountains and
the Pacific. Dr. Suckley found this bird very abundant at Fort Dalles
and at Puget Sound, at both of which places it is a constant summer resident.
It was always found in excellent condition. He states that it makes
its nest in low bushes, among the stalks of lupins and other shrub-like
weeds. Dr. Cooper also mentions that this bird is very abundant in all the
prairie districts of Washington Territory, especially where there are low
bushes. Unlike most of the Sparrows, it was also common on the coast
prairies, where he found it breeding. They arrive at the Straits of Fuca at
the end of March in large numbers, and leave for the South in October. He
afterwards found them at Fort Mohave, in the Colorado Valley, quite common
throughout the winter, some remaining until the 15th of May, but he
does not think that any remain there to breed. They are also abundant, in
winter, from San Francisco south, through all the inhabitable country. In
summer they are found in the Sierra Nevada, to their summits, and are also
plentiful in the regions north of the Columbia. A few remain, during the
summer, in the cool district about San Francisco. In June, 1854, Dr. Cooper
met with its nest near the mouth of the Columbia. It was built in a bush,
about a foot from the ground, formed of neatly interwoven grasses, and
lined with softer materials. He describes its song as loud, but short and
melancholy, heard at intervals during the whole year, and frequently at
night.</p>

<p>The Western White-crowned Sparrow was first met with by Mr. Ridgway,
<!--648.png--><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 571]</span>
at the Summit Meadows, near the summit of Donner Lake Pass of the Sierra
Nevada, at an altitude of about seven thousand feet. It was there an abundant
and characteristic bird. The males were in full song in all parts of the
meadow, and were nesting in such numbers that on the evening of July 9,
on halting for the night, in a hurried search no less than twenty-seven of
their eggs were obtained within about fifteen minutes. In every instance
the nests were embedded under a species of dwarf-willow, with which the
ground was covered. The birds were extremely unsuspicious, the male often
sitting on a bush within a few feet of the collector, and chanting merrily as
the eggs were being blown. In one instance, having occasion to repass a spot
from which a nest had been taken, the female was found sitting in the cavity
from which its nest had been removed. This species is only a winter visitant
of the lower country, but is there universally distributed, and always found
in bushy localities.</p>

<p>Mr. Bannister states that this bird was tolerably abundant among the
alder-bushes in certain parts of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Island. Mr. Dall found it
common at Nulato, and especially so at Fort Yukon. It arrived at Nulato
about May 20. Its nests and eggs were obtained from Indians at Nowikakat,
on the Yukon River. Dr. Kennerly met with these birds, in February,
at White Cliff Creek, New Mexico. They were first observed on approaching
the Big Sandy, and from thence to the Colorado they were found in abundance.
They were mostly in flocks, and were generally found among the
bushes, in the vicinity of water. He also met with it in the valley of the
Rio Grande, Corralitos, and Janos Rivers. It seemed to prefer the vicinity
of settlements, where it was always seen in greater numbers than elsewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found these birds common about San Antonio, Texas, during
the winter, arriving late in September. Some may remain and breed, as several
were observed there in June. Dr. Coues also found them abundant in
Arizona, where he first observed them September 15. After this they became
exceedingly numerous, and remained so until January. Later than this only
a few stragglers were seen, until April, when they again became abundant.
By far the greater part left, and proceeded north to breed.</p>

<p>These Sparrows were found breeding on the Yukon and at Fort Anderson
in great numbers by Messrs. MacFarlane, Lockhart, and Ross. Their nests
were in nearly all cases found upon the ground, often in tufts of grass,
clumps of Labrador tea, or other low bushes. They were composed of hay,
and, in nearly every instance, were lined with deer’s hair, and in a few with
feathers. A few were without any lining. In selecting a situation for their
nests, they seemed generally to give the preference to open or thinly wooded
tracts. The male bird was usually seen, or its note heard, in the immediate
vicinity of the nest. The eggs were obtained from the 4th of June to the
1st of July. Their maximum number was six; the most common, four.</p>

<p>Mr. B. R. Ross states that this species arrives at the Arctic Circle from
<!--649.png--><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 572]</span>
about the 15th to the 20th of May, and at Slave Lake only a few days
earlier. They are then no longer in flocks, but have already paired. They
commence nesting almost immediately upon their arrival at the Yukon and
at Fort Good Hope. Mr. Ross found nests made as early as May 20 to 25,
while there was still considerable snow upon the ground. They mostly nest,
however, in the first half of June, the young usually hatching between the
15th and 30th, and leaving the nests when less than a month old. They all
leave the Arctic Circle about the middle of September. A few were seen
at Fort Simpson in the latter part of that month. When starting, they
gather in small flocks. The nest is built on high ground, among low,
open bushes, always at the foot of some shrub or bush, and more or less
protected and concealed by grass. It is never placed in the edges of
marshes, like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melospiza lincolni</i>; nor on small prairies, like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerculus
savanna</i>; nor in thick woods, as does sometimes the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. albicollis</i>. The nest
is neatly built, is more compact and of finer materials than that of the
latter. It is large and deep, formed externally of coarse grass, and lined
with finer materials.</p>

<p>When started from her nest, the female flies off a few yards and flutters
silently along the ground to divert attention. If unsuccessful, she flies
about her nest uttering sharp, harsh notes of anxiety. The male is less
bold on such occasions. Their favorite habitat is light open bushes, affecting
neither open plains nor deep woods and never perching so high as
twenty feet from the ground, and usually, in all their movements, keeping
close to the earth.</p>

<p>Its food, so far as could be observed, consisted almost wholly of seeds,
sought mostly on the ground. It hatches only a single brood in a year.</p>

<p>Mr. B. R. Boss adds that this is the most abundant Sparrow throughout
the Mackenzie River region, and also the most interesting. Through the
spring and summer its melodious song, which strongly calls to mind the
first notes of the old air, “O Dear! what can the Matter be?” may be
heard from every thicket, both night and day. When sleeping in the
woods, Mr. Boss states that he has often been awakened by several of
these birds singing near him, answering each other, throughout the short
night, when all the other birds were silent. On this account, but for the
richness and melody of its song the bird would have made itself quite
disagreeable.</p>

<p>The Cree Indians name this Sparrow <i class="birdname">Wah-si-pis-chan</i>, because they think
this resembles its notes, the last of which are supposed to imitate the sound
of running water. It sings long after the breeding-season is past, and its
notes may be heard even into August.</p>

<p>The eggs measure .85 of an inch in length by .65 in breadth, and have a
ground of a greenish-white marked with a rusty-brown. They are of a
rounded-oval shape.</p>

Hood, from bill to upper part of nape, pure black, the middle longitudinal
third occupied by yellow on the anterior half, and pale ash on the posterior. Sides and
under parts of head and neck, with upper part of breast, ash-color, passing insensibly into
whitish on the middle of the body; sides and under tail-coverts tinged with brownish.
A yellowish spot above the eye, bounded anteriorly by a short black line from the eye to
the black of the forehead. This yellow spot, however, reduced to a few feathers in
spring dress. Interscapular region, with the feathers, streaked with dark brown, suffused
with dark rufous externally. Two narrow white bands on the wings. Bill dusky above,
paler beneath; legs flesh-color.</p>

<p class="small">Autumnal specimens have more or less of the whole top of head greenish-yellow; the
feathers somewhat spotted with dusky; the black stripe of the hood reduced to a narrow
superciliary line, or else to a spot anterior to the eye. Length about 7 inches; wing,

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Pacific coast from Russian America to Southern California; West Humboldt
Mountains, <abbr title="Nevada">Nev.</abbr> Black Hills of Rocky Mountains?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species, described and figured by Mr. Audubon as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fringilla
atricapilla</i>, is found in western North America, from Alaska to Southern
California and Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, and is almost entirely confined to the
Pacific Province, being known east of the Cascade Mountains and Sierra
Nevada only as stragglers. In its general habits it is said to greatly resemble
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. gambeli</i>. In the vicinity of Fort Dalles, and also in the neighborhood
of Fort Steilacoom, Dr. Suckley found it quite abundant in the summer.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper says that it is only a straggler in the forest regions west of the
Cascade Mountains, but that it probably migrates more abundantly to the
open plains eastward of them. He met with them but once near Puget
Sound, May 10, when they were apparently migrating. Dr. Cooper found a
few of this species wintering as far south as San Diego, associating with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z.
gambeli</i>. They were much less familiar, did not come about the houses, but
kept among the dense thickets. They were then silent, nor has he ever
heard them utter any song. He met with none near the summit of the
Sierra Nevada.</p>

<p>Dr. Newberry found these birds abundant in the vicinity of San Francisco
in winter.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall met with the young birds of this species on the central tablelands
<!--653.png--><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 574]</span>
of the Rocky Mountains, in the prairies. They were running on the
ground. He heard no note from them. He afterwards saw a few stragglers,
in the early part of winter, in the thickets of the forests of the Columbia
River, near Fort Vancouver. He also met with them, in the winter and
until late in the spring, in the woods and thickets of California.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann found this species very abundant in the fall season, generally
associated with the California Song Sparrow and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. gambeli</i>. It
resorts to the deep shady thickets and woods, where it passes the greater part
of its time. In the mountainous districts it prefers the hillsides, covered
with dense undergrowth. It occasionally breeds in California, as Dr. Heermann
found its nest in a bush near Sacramento City. It was composed of
coarse stalks of weeds, and lined internally with fine roots. The eggs were
four in number, and are described as having been of an ashy-white ground,
with markings of brown umber, at times appearing almost black from the
depth of their shade. They were marked also with a few spots of a neutral
tint.</p>

<p>Many of these birds were obtained in Sitka and in Kodiak, by Bischoff,
and also in British Columbia by Elliot.</p>

<p>Only one specimen of this species was met with by Mr. Ridgway in his
explorations with Mr. Clarence King’s survey. This was taken October 7,
1867, in the West Humboldt Mountains, in company with a flock of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z.

Two black stripes on the crown, separated by a median one of white. A
broad superciliary stripe from the base of the mandible to the occiput, yellow as far as the
middle of the eye and white behind this. A broad black streak on the side of the head
from behind the eye. Chin white, abruptly defined against the dark ash of the sides of
the head and upper part of the breast, fading into white on the belly, and margined by a
narrow black maxillary line. Edge of wing and axillaries yellow. Back and edges of
secondaries rufous-brown, the former streaked with dark brown. Two narrow white
bands across the wing-coverts. Length, 7 inches; wing, 3.10; tail, 3.20. Young of the

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern Province of North America to the Missouri. Breeding in most of the
northern United States and British Provinces, and wintering in the United States almost to
their southern limit. Aberdineshire, England, August 17, 1867 (Zoölogist, <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr>, 1869,
1547; <abbr title="Proceedings Zöological Society">P. Z. S.</abbr> 1857, 52). Scotland (Newton, <abbr title="Proceedings Zoölogical Society">Pr. Zoöl. Soc.</abbr> 1870, 52).</p>

<p><!--654.png--><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 575]</span>
Female smaller, and the colors rather duller. Immature and winter
specimens have the white chin-patch less abruptly defined, the white
markings on the top and sides of the head tinged with brown. Some
specimens, apparently mature, show quite distinct streaks on the breast and
sides of throat and body.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The White-throated Sparrow is, at certain seasons, an abundant
bird in all parts of North America, from the Great Plains to the Atlantic,
and from Georgia to the extreme Arctic regions. A few breed in favorable
situations in Massachusetts, especially in the extreme northwestern part of
the State. It breeds abundantly in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine,
and in all the British Provinces.</p>

<p>Sir John Richardson states that they reach the Saskatchewan in the middle
of May, and spread throughout the fur countries, as far, at least, as the
66th parallel, to breed. He states that he saw a female sitting on seven
eggs near the Cumberland House, as early as June 4. The nest was placed
under a fallen tree, was made of grass, lined with deer’s hair and a few
feathers. Another, found at Great Bear’s Lake, was lined with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">setæ</i> of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bryum uliginosum</i>. He describes the eggs as of a pale mountain-green,
thickly marbled with reddish-brown. When the female was disturbed, she
ran silently off in a crouching manner, like a Lark. He describes the note
of this bird as a clear song of two or three notes, uttered very distinctly, but
without variety,&mdash;a very incomplete description.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennicott states that this species does not extend its migrations as
far to the north as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. gambeli</i>, and is even much less numerous on the south
shores of the Slave Lake, where he did not observe half so many of this as
of the other. It also nests later, as he found the first nest observed on the
<abbr title="twenty-second">22d</abbr> of June, with the eggs quite fresh, incubation not having commenced,
and found others after that date. On English River he found two nests with
eggs on the 9th and 17th of July, and one near the Cumberland House on
the 30th of June. Two of these were in low swampy ground among large
trees, the other on high ground among small bushes. They were constructed
on large bases of moss, and lined with soft grasses. When startled from
her nest, the female always crept silently away through the grass.</p>

<p>He met with this species in considerable flocks, accompanied by small
numbers of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. leucophrys</i>, on the north shore of Lake Superior, on the 11th of
May. He saw individuals on the 29th of May, near the Lake of the Woods,
and it doubtless breeds as far south as that region. In the fall it was not
seen at Fort Simpson later than the last of September. As it is a much
more eastern bird than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. gambeli</i>, it is probably in greater abundance on the
eastern end of Slave Lake. Its song he regards as by no means so attractive
as that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. gambeli</i> or of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. leucophrys</i>. Its general habits are very much
like those of the former, and though by no means a strictly terrestrial bird,
it rarely perches high on trees, and generally flies near the ground, except
in its long migratory flights.</p>

<p><!--655.png--><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 576]</span>
Notwithstanding the slighting manner in which the song of this bird is
spoken of by some writers, in certain parts of the country its clear, prolonged,
and peculiar whistle has given to it quite a local fame and popularity.
Among the White Mountains, where it breeds abundantly, it is known
as the Peabody Bird, and its remarkably clear whistle resounds in all their
glens and secluded recesses. Its song consists of twelve distinct notes, which
are not unfrequently interpreted into various ludicrous travesties. As this
song is repeated with no variations, and quite frequently from early morning
until late in the evening, it soon becomes quite monotonous.</p>

<p>Among the White Mountains I have repeatedly found its nests. They
were always on the ground, usually sheltered by surrounding grass, and at
the foot of bushes or a tree, or in the woods under a fallen log. In that
region it retained all its wild, shy habits, rarely being found in the neighborhood
of dwellings or in cultivated grounds. But at Halifax this was
not so. There I found them breeding in gardens, on the edge of the city,
and in close proximity to houses, apparently not more shy than the common
Song Sparrow.</p>

<p>Wilson states that these birds winter in most of the States south of New
England, and he found them particularly numerous near the Roanoke River,
collecting in flocks on the borders of swampy thickets, among long rank
weeds, the seeds of which formed their principal food. He gives the 20th
of April as the date of their disappearance, but I have observed them lingering
in the Capitol grounds in Washington several weeks after that date.
They pass through Eastern Massachusetts from the 10th to the 20th of May,
and repass early in October. A few stragglers sometimes appear at earlier
dates, but irregularly. In Western Maine, where it is quite common, Professor
Verrill states that it sometimes arrives by the middle of April. Near
Springfield, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, Mr. Allen noted their appearance between the last of April
and the 20th of May; in fall, from the last of September through October.
Their favorite haunts are moist thickets. The young males do not acquire
their full plumage until the second spring, but sing and breed in the plumage
of the females, as Mr. Allen ascertained by dissection. Mr. Hildreth
observed a pair near Springfield during three successive summers, and although
he could not find the nest, he saw them feeding their scarcely fledged
young birds.</p>

<p>At Columbia, <abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>, Dr. Coues found these Sparrows very abundant, from
October through April. They sing, more or less, all winter, and during the
last few weeks of their stay are quite musical. Many hundreds pass the
months of March and April in the gardens of that city, though during the
winter they were mostly to be found in thickets and fields, in company with
many other species.</p>

<p>A single specimen of this bird was killed in Aberdeenshire, August 17,
1867, and a second was lately captured alive near Brighton (<abbr title="Proceedings Zoölogical Society">P. Z. S.</abbr>, June
4, 1872).</p>

<p><!--656.png--><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 577]</span>
Mr. Audubon says that this bird visits Louisiana and all the Southern
districts in winter, remaining from November to March, in great numbers.
They form groups of from thirty to fifty, and live together in great harmony,
feeding upon small seeds. At this time they are plump to excess, and are
regarded as a great delicacy.</p>

<p>When kept in confinement these birds become quite tame, and in the
spring will sing at all hours of the day or night.</p>

<p>The nest of this bird is usually, if not always, on the ground, but in
various situations, as I have found them on a hillside, in the midst of low
underbrush, in a swampy thicket, at the foot of some large tree in a garden,
as at Halifax, by the edge of a small pond, or in a hollow and decaying
stump. Their nest is large, deep, and capacious, with a base of moss or
coarse grasses, woven with finer stems above and lined with hair, a few
feathers, fine rootlets of plants or soft grasses. The eggs vary from four
to seven in number. Their ground-color is of a pale green or a greenish-white,
marked over the entire egg with a fox-colored or rusty brown. Occasionally
these markings are sparsely scattered, permitting the ground to be
plainly visible, but generally they are so very abundant as to cover the entire
egg so closely as to conceal all other shade, and give to the whole a deep
uniform rufous-brown hue, through which the under color of light green is
hardly distinguishable. They measure .90 by .68 of an inch.</p>

This species has a considerably larger bill than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. leucophrys</i>, the mandible
especially.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species was first described in 1840, by Mr. Nuttall, from
specimens obtained by him near Independence, Mo., near the close of the
month of April. He again met with them on the following 5th of May,
when not far from the banks of the Little Vermilion River, a branch of the
Kansas. He found them frequenting thickets, and uttering, chiefly in the
early morning, but also occasionally at other parts of the day, a long, drawling,
faint, solemn, and monotonous succession of notes, resembling <i class="birdcall">tē-dē-dē-dē</i>.</p>

<p>Since then but little additional information has been obtained in regard to
their general habits, their geographical distribution, or their mode of breeding,
single specimens only having been taken at considerable intervals in the
valley of the Missouri and elsewhere until 1872. Two specimens were secured
by Mr. Dresser, near San Antonio, in Western Texas, occurring on the
Medina River during their spring migrations. More recently this bird was
taken twice by Mr. H. W. Parker, in Jasper County, Iowa. The latest of
these was secured May 19.</p>

<p>Professor F. H. Snow, in his List of Kansas Birds, published April, 1872,
enumerates this species as a bird frequently taken in Kansas in the winter,
and probably resident; and Mr. J. A. Allen (American Naturalist, May,
1872) states that Harris’s Finch was, next to the Cardinal, the most abundant
species of the family of Sparrows and Finches in the vicinity of Leavenworth,
as it was also one of the largest and handsomest. He found it almost
exclusively frequenting the damper parts of the woods, associating with the
White-throated Sparrow, much resembling it both in habits and in song.
Nothing has so far been published respecting the nest and eggs.</p>

<p>The wing is rounded; the second quill longest; the third, fourth, and
fifth, successively, a little shorter; the first longer than the sixth. Tail
slightly rounded, and a little emarginate. In the full spring dress there is
<!--660.png--><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 581]</span>
no trace of any second color on the back, except an exceedingly faint and
scarcely appreciable wash of dull brownish over the whole upper parts.
The markings of the third tail-feather vary
somewhat in specimens. Sometimes the
whole tip is margined with brown; sometimes
the white extends to the end; sometimes
both webs are margined with brown;
sometimes the outer is white entirely;
sometimes the brownish wash on the back
is more distinct.</p>

<p>Some specimens (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 52,702 and 52,701,
males) from Sun River, Dakota, appear to
be hybrids with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oregonus</i>. They have the
general appearance of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hyemalis</i>, the back
being nearly uniform with the head (with
a wash of sepia-brown, however), and the head and neck of the same dark
plumbeous; the sides, however, are pinkish, and the plumbeous on the
jugulum has its posterior outline convex, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oregonus</i>. If, as there is
every reason to believe, these specimens are really hybrids, then we have the
two extreme forms of the genus connected by specimens of such a condition;
thus, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hyemalis</i> with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oregonus</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oregonus</i> with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caniceps</i> (= <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">annectens</i>,
Baird), and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caniceps</i> with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cinereus</i>
(= <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dorsalis</i>, Henry). It may perhaps be
considered a serious question whether all (including <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alticola</i>) are not, in
reality, geographical races of one species. However, as there is no possibility
of ever proving this, it may be best to consider them as representative
species, and these specimens of intermediate characters as hybrids.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common familiar Snowbird of the Eastern States is found
throughout all North America, east of the Black Hills, from Texas to the
Arctic regions. Wherever found, it is at certain seasons a very abundant
and an equally familiar bird.</p>

<p>It nests as far south, in mountainous regions, as Virginia, and thence to
New York and the northern parts of the New England States, breeding only
in the highlands, but descending more and more into the plains as we proceed
north. As it is a very hardy bird, its migrations are irregular and
uncertain. In some seasons I have observed but few at irregular intervals;
and in others, in which the spring was cold and backward, I have met with
them in every month except July and August.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennicott found but few birds of this species breeding as far south as
Fort Resolution or Slave Lake, and was unable to find any of their nests,
though he met with a few birds that were evidently breeding there. He
found it afterwards nesting in the greatest abundance about latitude 65<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>.
They were very numerous on the Yukon, and Mr. MacFarlane found them
breeding plentifully on the Anderson River, at the edge of the barren-ground
region.</p>

<p><!--661.png--><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 582]</span>
The nests found by Mr. Kennicott were all on the ground, more or less
concealed in tufts of grass, dry leaves, or projecting roots. Some were in
thick woods, others in more open regions, and were lined with moose-hair.</p>

<p>Mr. Ross states that this species frequents all the Mackenzie River region
in summer, arriving about the 20th of April, and leaving about the 10th of
October. Besides its call-note, or chirp, it has a very pretty song.</p>

<p>Mr. Dall also remarks that they were quite common at Nulato in the
spring, not arriving there, however, until about the first of June.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Dresser, it is found occasionally about San Antonio
in winter, and Dr. Woodhouse says that it is also common in the Indian
Territory in fall and winter. According to Mr. Audubon, it makes its
appearance in Louisiana in November, and remains there until early spring.
It is also abundant in South Carolina, arriving there in October and leaving
in April.</p>

<p>This species was observed by Mr. Aiken in Colorado Territory for about
three weeks following March 20, after which they were seen no more.</p>

<p>It breeds more or less abundantly in the northern and eastern portions of
Maine. About Calais and in all the islands of the Bay of Fundy, and
throughout New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, I found this by far the most
common and familiar species, especially at Pictou, where it abounded in
the gardens, in repeated instances coming within the outbuildings to build
its nests. In a woodshed connected with the dwelling of Mr. Dawson, my
attention was called to the nests of several of these birds, built within reach
of the hand, and in places where the family were passing and repassing
throughout the day. In Pictou they were generally called the Bluebird by
the common people. On my ride from Halifax to Pictou, I also found these
birds breeding by the roadside, often under the shelter of a projecting bank,
in the manner of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerculus savanna</i>. I afterward found them nesting
in similar situations among the White Mountains, the roadsides seeming to
be a favorite situation. In habits and notes, at Pictou, they reminded me
of the common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spizella socialis</i>, but were, if anything, more fearless and
confiding, coming into the room where the family were at their meals, and
only flying away when they had secured a crumb of sufficient size.</p>

<p>In Western Massachusetts they breed in all parts of the range of Green
Mountains, from Blandford to North Adams. They appear about Springfield
in October and November, and are for a while abundant, and are then
gone until March, when they return in full song, and remain numerous into
April, and less common until into May. In the eastern part of the State
they are found from October to late in May, with some irregularity and in
varying numbers. Mr. Audubon did not meet with any on the coast of
Labrador, and Dr. Coues did not find them so abundant as he expected, and
did not observe any until the latter part of July, at which time the young
were already hatched, and they were associated in small companies. They
kept entirely in the thick woods, and seemed rather timid.</p>

<p><!--662.png--><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 583]</span>
Their food is small berries, seeds of grasses and small plants, insects,
and larvæ. They seek the latter on the ground, and in the winter are said
to frequent the poultry-yards, and avail themselves of the services of the
fowls in turning up the earth. On the ground they hop about in a peculiar
manner, apparently without moving their feet. At night and during storms
they shelter themselves in the thick branches of evergreens, and also in
stacks of hay and piles of brushwood.</p>

<p>During the winter the Snowbird appears to be rather more numerous in
the Middle and Southern States than in New England. In the former they
appear late in October, at first on the borders of woods, searching for food
among the fallen and decaying leaves. Later in the season, as the weather
becomes colder, and the snow deprives them of this means of feeding,
they resort to the roadsides and feed on the seeds of the taller weeds,
and to the farm-houses and farm-yards, and even enter within the limits of
large cities, where they become very tame and familiar. They are much
exposed to attacks from several kinds of Hawks, and the apparent timidity
they evince at certain times and places is due to their apprehensions of
this danger. The sudden rustle of the wings of a harmless fowl will cause
the whole flock to take at once to flight, returning as soon as their alarm is
found to be needless, but repeated again and again when the same dreaded
sounds are heard.</p>

<p>Neither Wilson, Nuttall, nor Audubon appear to have ever met with the
nests or eggs of this bird, though the first met with them breeding both
among the Alleghanies, in Virginia, and the highlands of Pennsylvania and
New York. In Otsego County, in the latter State, Mr. Edward Appleton
was the first to discover and identify their nest and eggs, as cited by Mr.
Audubon in the third volume of his Birds of America. They were found
in considerable numbers in the town of Otsego. Their nests were on
the ground in sheltered positions, some of them with covered entrances.
Their complement of eggs was four. One of their nests was sent me, and
was characteristic of all I have since seen, having an external diameter of
four and a half inches and a depth of two. The cavity was deep and capacious
for the bird. The base and periphery of the nest were made of slender
strips of bark, coarse straws, fine roots, and horsehair, lined with fine mosses
and the fur of smaller animals. The eggs were of a rounded-oval shape;
their ground-color is a creamy yellowish-white, marked with spots and
blotches of a reddish-brown confluent around the larger portion of the egg,
but rarely covering either end. They measure .75 by .60 of an inch, not
varying in size from those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J. oregonus</i>.</p>

Generally similar to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J. hyemalis</i>, but considerably larger, with more robust

quills, and tail-feathers darker; middle and secondary wing-coverts rather broadly tipped
with white, forming two conspicuous bands. Lower part of the breast, abdomen, and
crissum pure white, the anterior outline against the ash of the jugulum convex; sides
tinged with ash. Three lateral tail-feathers entirely white, the third, however, with a
narrow streak of dusky on the terminal third of the outer web; the next feather mostly
plumbeous, with the basal fourth of the outer web, and the terminal half of the inner, along
the shaft, white. Wing, 3.40; tail, 3.20; culmen, .50; depth of bill at base, .30; tarsus, .80.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
El Paso County, Colorado.</p>

<p>At first sight, this bird appears to be a very distinct species, being larger
than any other North American form, and possessing in the white bands on
the wing characters entirely peculiar. Its large size, however, we can attribute
to its alpine habitat, agreeing in this respect, as compared with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J.
hyemalis</i>, with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J. alticola</i> of Guatemala, which we can only consider an
alpine or somewhat local form of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J. cinereus</i>. That the white bands on the
wing do not constitute a character sufficiently important to be considered of
specific value is proved by the fact that in many specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J. oregonus</i>,
and occasionally in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J. hyemalis</i>, there is sometimes quite a distinct tendency
to these bands in the form of obscure white tips to the coverts.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> But little is known as to the habits of this variety; probably
they do not differ from those of its congeners. It was met with by Mr.
C. E. Aiken, near Fountain, El Paso County, in Colorado Territory, in the
winter of 1871-72. They were rare in the early winter, became rather
common during the latter part of February and the first of March, and had
all disappeared by the first of April. During winter only males were seen,
but, in the spring, the females were the most numerous. They were usually
seen singly, or in companies of two or three, and not, like the others, in
larger flocks.</p>

Head and neck all round sooty-black; this color extending to the upper
part of the breast, but not along the sides under the wings, and with convex outline
behind. Interscapular region of the back and exposed surface of the wing-coverts and
secondaries dark rufous-brown, forming a square patch. A lighter, more pinkish tint of
the same on the sides of breast and belly. Rest of under parts clear white. Rump
brownish-ash. Upper tail-coverts dusky. Outer two tail-feathers white; the third with
only an obscure streak of white. Bill flesh-color, dusky at tip. Legs flesh-color. Length
about 6.50 inches; wing, 3.00.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Pacific coast of the United States to the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains,
and north to Alaska. Stragglers as far east as Fort Leavenworth in winter and Great
Bend of Missouri.</p>

<p>Sitka and Oregon specimens have the back of a darker rufous than those
from California and the Middle Province, in which this portion of the body,
as well as the sides, is paler, and in more abrupt contrast with the head.</p>

<p>Immature and the majority of winter specimens do not have the black
of the head and neck so well defined, but edged above more or less with the
color of the back, below with light ashy.</p>

<p>The Oregon Snowbird in full plumage is readily distinguishable from the
eastern species by the purer white of the belly; the more sharply defined
outline of the black of the head passes directly across the upper part of the
breast, and is even convex in its posterior outline, without extending down
the side of the breast, with its posterior outline strongly concave, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hyemalis</i>.
The absence of black or ashy-brown under the wings, with the rufous
tinge, are highly characteristic of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oregonus</i>. The head and neck are considerably
blacker; the rufous of the back and wings does not exist in the other.
The wings and quills are more pointed; the second quill usually longest, instead
of the third, etc. The dusky of the throat reaches in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J. oregonus</i> only
to the upper part of the breast; to its middle region in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hyemalis</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in adult males, the middle and greater wing-coverts are faintly
tipped with white, indicating two inconspicuous bands.</p>

<p>In a large series of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Juncos</i> collected at Fort Whipple, Arizona, by Dr.
Coues, are several specimens so decidedly intermediate between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J. oregonus</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J. caniceps</i> as to suggest the probability of their being hybrids; others,
from Fort Burgwyn and Fort Bridger, are exactly like them. With the ashy
head and jugulum, and black lores, as well as bright rufous back, of the latter,
the sides are pinkish as in the former; while, as in this too, the posterior outline
of the ash on jugulum is convex, not concave, and the rufous of the back
has a tendency to tinge the wings, instead of being confined to the interscapulars.

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Dr. Suckley found this bird extremely abundant in Oregon and
Washington Territory, where it holds about the same position that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hyemalis</i>
<!--665.png--><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 586]</span>
does in the Eastern States. Dr. Cooper states it to be a very common
bird in Washington Territory, especially in the winter, when it comes about
the houses and farms with precisely the same habits as the common Atlantic
species. In the summer it is seen about Puget Sound, in which neighborhood
it breeds. He met with young fledglings as early as May 24. At that season
they were not gregarious, and were found principally about the edges of woods.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway also regards the western Snowbird as, in all appreciable
respects, an exact counterpart of the eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hyemalis</i>. In summer he found
it inhabiting the pine woods of the mountains, but in winter descending to
the lowlands, and entering the towns and gardens in the same manner with
the eastern species.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper states this species to be numerous in winter in nearly every
part of California. In the summer it resides among the mountains down to
the <abbr title="thirty-second">32d</abbr> parallel. On the coast he has not determined its residence farther
south than Monterey. The coolness of that locality, and its extensive forests
of pines extending to the coast, favor the residence of such birds during
the summer. At San Diego he observed them until the first of April, when
they retired to the neighboring mountains. A few also were found in the
Colorado Valley in the winter. On the Coast Mountains south of Santa
Clara he found them breeding in large numbers in May, 1864. One nest
contained young, just ready to fly, as early as May 13. This was built in a
cavity among the roots of a large tree on a steep bank. It was made of
leaves, grasses, and fine root-fibres. On the outside it was covered with an
abundant coating of green moss, raised above the surface of the ground. The
old birds betrayed the presence of the nest by their extreme anxiety. On
the 20th he found another nest on the very summit of the mountains, supposed
to be a second laying, as it contained but three eggs. It was slightly
sunk in the ground under a fern, and formed like the other, but with less
moss around its edge. It was lined with cows’ and horses’ hair. The eggs
were bluish-white, with blackish-brown spots of various sizes thickly sprinkled
around the larger end, and measuring .74 by .60 of an inch.</p>

<p>The only song Dr. Cooper noticed, of this species, was a faint trill much
like that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spizella socialis</i>, delivered from the top of some low tree in
March and April. At other times they have only a sharp call-note, by which
they are distinguishable from other Sparrows. While some migrate far to
the south in winter, others remain as far north as the Columbia River, frequenting,
in large numbers, the vicinity of barns and houses, especially when
the snow is on the ground. They raise two broods in a season.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found this species a very common winter resident in Arizona,
arriving at Fort Whipple about October 10, soon becoming very abundant,
and continuing so until the second week in April. Stragglers were seen until
May 10.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse also observed numbers of the western Snowbird on the
San Francisco Mountains, in the month of October, where they were very
<!--666.png--><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 587]</span>
abundant. Many specimens were obtained in Sitka by Mr. Bischoff. None
have so far been recorded from the Aleutian Islands.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly frequently saw these birds near the Pueblo of Zuñi in New
Mexico; in the months of October and November they were very abundant
among the cedars to the westward of that settlement as far as the Little
Colorado. Dr. Heermann also met with them near Fort Yuma in December,
having previously noticed them during the fall, migrating in large flocks.</p>

<p>Mr. Aiken frequently found this species throughout the winter in Colorado.
It was very common during March and the first of April. By May
only a few straggling females were seen, and then they all disappeared.</p>

<p>The nests of this species have a general resemblance in structure to those
of the common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hyemalis</i>. They are well constructed and remarkably symmetrical,
made externally of mosses and other coarse materials, within which
is very nicely woven an inner nest of fine, bent stems of grasses, lined
with hair. The eggs, four or five in number, resemble those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hyemalis</i>,
but are lighter. They have a ground-color of greenish-white, marked about
the larger end with fine dots of reddish-brown. Their measurement is .75
by .60 of an inch.</p>

Bill yellowish; black at the tip. Above ashy (of the same shade before
and behind); the head and neck all round of this color, which extends (paling a little)
along the sides, leaving the middle of the belly and crissum quite abruptly white. Lores
conspicuously but not very abruptly darker. Interscapular region abruptly reddish chestnut-brown,
which does not extend on the wings, and makes a triangular patch. Two
outer tail-feathers entirely white; third with a long white terminal stripe on the inner
web. Young streaked with blackish above and below, except along middle of belly and

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Rocky Mountains; from Black Hills to San Francisco Mountains, Arizona.
Wahsatch and Uintah Mountains (<span class="sc">Ridgway</span>).</p>

<p>This species is similar to the common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J. hyemalis</i> in color, though paler;
the tint of the under parts and sides is not quite so dark, and is less abruptly
defined against the white. The conspicuous chestnut patch on the back and
the dusky lores will distinguish them. The edge of the outer web of the
third tail-feather is brown, not white. It differs from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oregonus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cinereus</i> in
having no chestnut on the wings, especially the tertials, and from the former
in the extension of the ash of the neck along the sides and much lighter head.</p>

<p>Young birds are streaked above and below as in other species; they may
be distinguished from those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cinereus</i> by the rufous being confined to the
interscapular region, the same as in the adult.</p>

<p><!--667.png--><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 588]</span>
The type skin of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Junco dorsalis</i> of Dr. Henry (see foot-note to synoptical
table, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 580) differs mainly in having the whole upper mandible entirely
black, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J. cinereus</i>; and, as in the latter, the jugulum is pale ash, fading
gradually into the white of the abdomen, instead of deep ash abruptly defined.
It is very probably, as suggested by Mr. Ridgway, a hybrid with
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J. cinereus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species was first discovered and described by Dr. Woodhouse
from specimens obtained by him among the San Francisco Mountains
in Arizona. When procured, it was feeding in company with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Junco oregonus</i>
and various species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parus</i>. Its habits appeared to be very similar
to those of the western Snowbird, as well as to those of the common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J.
hyemalis</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues states that he found this bird a not very common winter resident
at Fort Whipple, where its times of arrival and departure, as well as its
general habits, were identical with those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J. oregonus</i>, with which it very
freely associated. From this we may naturally infer that in New Mexico
and Arizona it appears only as a winter visitant, and that in summer it goes
elsewhere to breed. Its summer resorts, as well as our knowledge of its
breeding-habits, nest, and eggs, remain to be determined, or are only imperfectly
known. It evidently retires to the highlands and to mountain regions
to breed, and probably has a much more extended habitat than that of
which we now have any knowledge. Upon this problem Mr. Ridgway’s
observations have already shed some valuable and suggestive light. He
met with this bird only among the pine woods of the Wahsatch Mountains,
where, however, it was a very common bird, and where it was also breeding.
Its manners and notes were scarcely different from those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J. oregonus</i>. It
is, however, a shyer bird than the latter, and its song, which is only a simple
trill, is rather louder than that of either the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hyemalis</i> or the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oregonus</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues writes me that both “the Gray-head and the Oregon Snowbirds
are common species about Fort Whipple in winter, arriving about the middle
of October, and remaining in numbers until early in April, when they thin
off, although some may usually be observed during the month, and even a
part of the next. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oregonus</i> far outnumbers <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caniceps</i>. So far as I could
see, their habits are precisely the same as those of the eastern Snowbird.
During snow-storms they used to come familiarly about our quarters, and I
once captured several of both species, enticing them into a tent in which
some barley had been strewn, and having the flap fixed so that it could be
pulled down with a string in a moment. They always associated together,
and once, on firing into a flock, I picked up a number of each kind, and one
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Junco hyemalis</i>. The latter can only be considered a straggler in this region,
although I secured three specimens one winter.”</p>

<p>This species was very rare in Colorado, according to Mr. Aiken, in the
winter of 1871-72, but became common in March, and a few remained up
to the <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> of May. No females of this species were observed by him.</p>

<p><!--668.png--><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 589]</span>
Mr. J. A. Allen mentions first meeting with this species at an elevation
of seven thousand feet, and from that height it was common, on the slopes
of Mount Lincoln, to the extreme limit of the timber line.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Black-throated Sparrow, generically associated with Bell’s
Finch, has several well-marked distinctive peculiarities in habits. Their
eggs are also totally unlike those of the present species, being much more
<!--670.png--><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 591]</span>
like those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Peucæa</i> and of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leucosticte griseinucha</i>, and, like them, white
and unspotted.</p>

<p>This species was first described by Mr. Cassin from specimens obtained in
Western Texas by John W. Audubon, and its habitat was at first supposed to
be restricted to the valleys of the Rio Grande and the Gila, but more recent
explorations show it to have a much wider distribution. It is found from
Western Texas through part of Mexico, New Mexico, the Indian Territory,
and Arizona, to Southern California, and towards the north throughout the
region of the Great Basin to an extent not yet fully determined. In portions
at least of this territory it is migratory, and only resident in the summer
months.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found this Sparrow very abundant during July and August in
the mesquite thickets in the town of Matamoras. In December it was
equally common at Eagle Pass, but at San Antonio it was quite a rare bird.
He only observed it on two or three occasions at a rancho on the Medina
River, and late in June a nest and four eggs were obtained. Between Laredo
and Matamoras, after crossing the Nueces, he found these birds very numerous,
and near Laredo met with several nests, some containing young and some
eggs nearly hatched. One taken on the 20th of July contained three fresh
eggs, probably indicating a second laying. This nest was in a low bush,
carefully concealed. It was composed of straws and lined with fine roots.
The eggs, when fresh, were nearly white, with a delicate bluish tinge. On
his journey down the river he found many nests, all empty or containing
young. Some of these were partially lined with cotton. Though not wild,
the birds were so restless that he found it difficult to shoot them. Dr.
Woodhouse obtained one specimen on the Rio Pedro, in Texas.</p>

<p>In Mexico this Sparrow was found by Lieutenant Couch to be numerous
in parts of Tamaulipas, Nueva Leon, Coahuila, and other States on the
Rio Grande, immediately south and west of the limits of the territory of the
United States. It was first seen at Santa Rosalio, and specimens obtained,
though none were noticed at Brownsville, only twenty miles east, during a
month’s residence. At Charco Escondido, forty miles farther in the interior,
it was very plentiful, and although it was early in March, had already reared
a brood of young, one specimen appearing to be a young bird only a few
weeks old. Its favorite home appeared to be the scattered mesquite, on
the plains east of the Sierra Madre. During the warm hours of the day it
does not seek the shade, but may always be found chirping and hopping from
one bush to another. South of Cadoreita the birds disappeared, but after a
month’s loss of their company he again met with them among some flowering
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leguminosa</i>, between Pesquieria and Rinconada. He thus found it several
times entirely absent from districts of considerable extent, but always reappearing
again throughout his journey. The usual note of this bird, at the season
in which he met with it, was a simple chirp; but on one occasion, having
halted during a norther in Tamaulipas, he heard a “gay little black-throated
<!--671.png--><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 592]</span>
fellow,” regardless of the bitter wind, from the top of a yellow mimosa then
in bloom, give utterance to a strain of sprightly and sweet notes, that would
compare favorably with those of many more famed songsters.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found this Sparrow very abundant in the southern and western
portions of Arizona, though rare at Fort Whipple, where the locality was
unsuited to it, as it seemed to prefer open plains, grassy or covered with sagebrush.</p>

<p>Mr. J. H. Clarke, who met with these birds in Tamaulipas, Texas, and
New Mexico, speaks of them as abundant and widely distributed. He
found them on the lower Rio Grande, but more abundantly in the interior,
seeming to prefer the stunted and sparse vegetation of the sand-hills and
dry plains to the cottonwood groves and willow thickets of the river valleys,
where they were never seen. They would be very inconspicuous did
not the male occasionally perch himself on some topmost branch and pour
forth a continuous strain of music. In the more barren regions they were
the almost exclusive representatives of the feathered tribes.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann first remarked this Finch near Tucson, in Arizona, where he
found it associated with other Sparrows in large flocks. They were flying
from bush to bush, alighting on the ground to pick up grass-seeds and insects.
They were quite numerous, and he traced them as far into Texas as
the Dead Man’s Hole, between El Paso and San Antonio.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found a few of these birds on the treeless and waterless mountains
that border the Colorado Valley, in pairs or in small companies, hopping
along the ground, under the scanty shrubbery. In crossing the Providence
Range, in May, Dr. Cooper found their nest, containing white eggs.</p>

<p>Both species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poospiza</i>, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">belli</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bilineata</i>, according to Mr.
Ridgway, are entirely peculiar in their manners, habits, and notes. Both, he
states, are birds characteristic of the arid artemisia plains of the Great Basin,
and, with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eremophila cornuta</i>, are often the only birds met with on those
desert wastes. The two species, he adds, are quite unlike in their habits and
manners. They each have about the same extent of habitat, and even often
frequent the same locality. While the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. bilineata</i> is partial to dry sandy
situations, inhabiting generally the arid <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mesa</i> extending from the river valleys
back to the mountains, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. belli</i> is almost confined to the more
thrifty growth of the artemisia, as found in the damper valley portions.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. belli</i> is a resident species, and even through the severest winters is
found in abundance. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. bilineata</i> is exclusively a summer bird, one of
the latest to come from the South, and much the more shy of the two;
its manners also are quite different.</p>

<p>Both birds have one common characteristic, which renders them worthy
of especial remark. This is the peculiar delivery and accent, and the strange
sad tone of their spring song, which, though unassuming and simple, is indeed
strange in the effect it produces. This song, so plaintive and mournful,
harmonizes with the dull monotony of the desert landscape.</p>

<p><!--672.png--><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 593]</span>
Mr. Ridgway states that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. bilineata</i> is not so abundant as the other
species, and is more retiring in its habits. It principally frequents the desert
tracts and sandy wastes, on which are found only the most stunted forms of
sage-brush. Its song, though quite simple, is exceedingly fine, its modulation
being somewhat like <i class="birdcall">wut´-wut´-ze-e-e-e-e-e</i>, the first two syllables being
uttered in a rich metallic tone, while the final trill is in a lower key, and of
the most liquid and tremulous character imaginable. This simple chant is
repeated every few seconds, the singer being perched upon a bush. He adds
that this bird arrives on the Truckee Reservation about the 13th of May.
The nest is built in sage-bushes, and the eggs are found from the 7th to
the 21st of June. The nests are usually about one foot from the ground, or
thereabouts.</p>

<p>The eggs vary in size from .70 by .55 of an inch to .75 by .60. They are
of a rounded-oval shape, and of a pure white with a slight tinge of blue,
somewhat resembling the eggs of the Bachman Finch.</p>

Upper parts generally, with sides of head and neck, uniform bluish-ash,
tinged with yellowish-gray on the crown and back, and with a few very obsolete dusky
streaks on the interscapular region. Beneath pure white, tinged with yellowish-brown on
the sides and under the tail. Eyelids, short streak from the bill to above the eye, and small
median spot at the base of culmen, white. A stripe on the sides of the throat and spot
on the upper part of the breast, with a few streaks on the sides, with the loral space and
region round the eyes, plumbeous-black. Tail-feathers black; the outer edged with white.
Wing-feathers all broadly edged with brownish-yellow; the elbow-joint tinged with
yellowish-green. Bill and feet blue. Length, 5.70; wing, 2.80; tail, 2.90. (Largest

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Southern California.</p>

<p>The colors are softer and more blended in the autumn; the young are
obsoletely streaked on the breast.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Bell’s Finch has apparently a more restricted distribution than
the Black-throated species, and is resident wherever found. It has been met
with at Posa Creek, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, by Dr. Heermann, at Fort Thorn by Dr. T. C.
Henry, and along the Colorado River by Drs. Kennerly and Möllhausen.
It has likewise been found in Southern California, as far north as Sacramento
Valley, and in the valley of the Gila.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper states that all the extensive thickets throughout the southern
half of California are the favorite resorts of this bird. There they
apparently live upon small seeds and insects, indifferent as to water, or
<!--673.png--><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 594]</span>
depending upon what they obtain from dews or fogs. They reside all the
year in the same localities, and were also numerous on the island of San
Nicolas, eighty miles from the mainland. In spring the males utter, as Dr.
Cooper says, a low monotonous ditty, from the top of some favorite shrub,
answering each other from long distances. Their nest he found about three
feet from the ground, composed of grasses and slender weeds, lined with
hair and other substances. The eggs, four in number, he describes as pale
greenish, thickly sprinkled over with reddish-brown dots. At San Diego he
found the young hatched out by May 18, but thinks they are sometimes
earlier. It is also a common bird in the chaparral of Santa Clara Valley,
and also, according to Dr. Heermann, along the Cosumnes River.</p>

<p>In Arizona, according to Dr. Coues, it is rather uncommon about Fort
Whipple, owing to the unsuitable nature of the locality, but is abundant
among the sage-brush of the Gila Valley, where it keeps much on the
ground, and where its movements are very much like those of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilo</i>.</p>

<p>Drs. Kennerly and Möllhausen met with these Sparrows on the Little
Colorado River, in California, December 15. They were found during that
month along the banks of the river wherever the weeds and bushes were
thick. It was never observed very far from the water, and its food, at that
season, seemed to consist of the seeds of various kinds of weeds. Its
motions were quick, and, when started up, its flight was short, rapid, and
near the earth.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann states that in the fall of 1851 he found this species in the
mountains bordering the Cosumnes River, and afterwards on the broad tract
of arid land between Kerr River and the Tejon Pass, and again on the desert
between that and the Mohave River. He often found them wandering to a
great distance from water. With only a few exceptions, these were the only
birds inhabiting the desolate plains, where the artemisia is the almost exclusive
vegetation. When undisturbed, it chants merrily from some bush-top,
but, at the approach of danger, drops at once to the ground and disappears
in the shrubbery or weeds. Its nest he found built in a bush, composed of
twigs and grasses, and lined with hair. The eggs, four in number, he
describes as of a light greenish-blue, marked with reddish-purple spots, differing
in intensity of shade.</p>

<p>The difference in size between
the race of the Great Basin and
that of the southern Pacific Province,
of this species, is quite remarkable,
being much greater
than in any other instance within
our knowledge. This may,
perhaps, be explained by the fact
that the former is not migratory,
but resident even in the most northern part of its range; while the California
one is also resident, and an inhabitant of only the southern portion of the
coast region, not reaching nearly so far north as the race of the interior.</p>

<p>The coloration of the two races is quite identical, though in all specimens
of <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">belli</i> the dorsal streaks are obsolete, sometimes even apparently
wanting, while in the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nevadensis</i> they are always conspicuous. The
former appears to be more brownish above than the latter.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> These birds, Mr. Ridgway states, have a very general distribution,
extending as far west as the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada. At Carson
City, February 27, he heard for the first time their sweet sad chant. A week
later he found the sage-brush full of these birds, the males being in full song
and answering one another from all directions. In walking through the sage-brush
these Sparrows were seen on every side, some running upon the ground
with their tails elevated, uttering a chipping twitter, as they sought to conceal
themselves behind the shrubs. Some were seen to alight upon the tops of
dead stalks, where they sit with their tails expanded almost precisely after
the manner of the Kingbird. The song of this bird is feeble, but is unsurpassed
for sweetness and sadness of tone. While its effect is very like the
song of a Meadow Lark singing afar off, there is, besides its peculiar sadness,
something quite unique in its modulation and delivery. It is a chant,
in style somewhat like the spring warbling of the Shore Lark.</p>

<p>On the 24th of March, at Carson City, he found these Sparrows very
abundant and everywhere the predominating species, as it was also the most
unsuspicious and familiar. It was even difficult to keep them from under
the feet. A pair would often run before him for a distance of several rods
with their unexpanded tails elevated, and when too nearly approached would
only dodge in among the bushes instead of flying off.</p>

<p>On the 9th of April, walking among the sage-brush near Carson City, Mr.
Ridgway found several nests of this Sparrow, the female parent in each
<!--675.png--><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 596]</span>
instance betraying the position of her nest by running out, as he approached,
from the bush beneath which it was concealed. With elevated
tail, running rapidly and silently away, they disappeared among the shrubbery.
In such cases a careful examination of the spot was sure to result
in finding an artfully concealed nest, either embedded in the ground or a
few inches above it in the lower branches of the bush. He did not find this
species east of the northern end of Great Salt Lake, nor was it seen in the
neighborhood of Salt Lake City, where the other species was so abundant.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species differ very essentially from those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. bilineata</i>.
They are oblong in shape, have a light greenish ground, marked all
over the egg with very fine dots of a reddish-brown, and around the larger
end with a ring of confluent blotches of dark purple and lines of a darker
brown, almost black. They measure .80 by .60 of an inch. They resemble
very closely a not uncommon variety of the eggs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spizella pusilla</i>.</p>

Dr. Coues, in his “Key to North American Birds,” gives an able and

Carus and Gerstaecker (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Handbuch der Zoologie</span>, 1868, 191) present
the following definition of birds as a class:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="footnote"><b class="birdname">Aves.</b>
Skin covered wholly or in part with feathers. Anterior pair of
limbs, converted into wings, generally used in flight; sometimes
rudimentary. Occiput with a single condyle. Jaws encased in horny
sheaths, which form a bill; lower jaw of several elements and
articulated behind with a distinct quadrate bone attached to the
skull. Heart with double auricle and double ventricle. Air-spaces
connected to a greater or less extent with the lungs; the skeleton
more or less pneumatic. Diaphragm incomplete. Pelvis generally open.
Reproduction by eggs, fertilized within the body, and hatched
externally, either by incubation or by solar heat; the shells
calcareous and hard.</p>

also to be found in other groups, nor is the collocation of their
characters peculiar.</p>

are scarcely found. For, in those non-passerine birds, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Raptores</i>
and some <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Herodiones</i>, in which the claw is enlarged, the wing-coverts
are otherwise disposed; and similarly when, as in many <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pici</i> and
elsewhere, the coverts are of a passerine character, the feet are
highly diverse.</p>

In the true conirostral or fringilliform genera the under
mandible has high strong tomia, bent at an angle near the base; the
corresponding portion of the upper mandible is deep, so that the
nostrils are nearer the culmen than the tomia. The whole bill is more
or less bent in its axis from the axis of the cranial base, so that
the palate curves down, or is excavated or, as it were, is broken into
two planes meeting at an angle,&mdash;one plane the anterior hard
imperforate roof of the mouth, the other the back palate where the
internal nares are situate (Sundevall). The single North American
genus of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tanagridæ</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyranga</i>) is here conventionally ranged on
account of its high nostrils and conic bill, although it does not show
angulation of the tomia. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icteridæ</i>, with obviously angulated
tomia, shade into the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fringillidæ</i> in shortness and thickness of

joint of the middle toe by a membrane which stretches across to within
two fifths of the end of the latter; there appears, however, to be no
ligamentous adhesion. The basal joint of the outer toe is entirely
adherent, and a membrane extends from nearly the basal half of the
second joint to the distal end of the first joint of the middle toe.
When this connecting membrane becomes dried the division of the toes
appears considerably greater.</p>

<p class="footnote">From a careful examination of specimens of the above forms, the opinion that they are all local
differentiations of one primitive type at once presents itself. The differences from the typical
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subis</i> are not great, except in the white-bellied group (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominicensis</i> and its allies), while an
approach to the white belly of these is plainly to be seen in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. cryptoleuca</i>; again, some specimens
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominicensis</i> have the crissum mixed with blackish, while others have it wholly snowy-white.
While the male of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cryptoleuca</i> is scarcely distinguishable, at first sight, from that of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subis</i>, the female is entirely different, but, on the other hand, scarcely to be distinguished from
that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominicensis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">leucogaster</i>. Adult males of the latter species are much like adult
females of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominicensis</i>, while Floridan (resident) specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subis</i> approach very decidedly to
the rather unique characters of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">elegans</i>. It is therefore extremely probable that all are merely
local modifications of one species.</p>

Comparing typical examples of this “species” with those of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gilvus</i> from North America, they appear very widely different indeed, so far as coloration is
concerned, though nearly identical in form. But a specimen from an intermediate locality
(54,262, Orizaba, Mexico, F. <span class="sc">Sumichrast</span>) combines so perfectly all the characters of the two,
that it would be impossible to refer it to one or the other as distinct species. It therefore
becomes necessary to assume that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. josephæ</i> is a permanently resident tropical race of a
species of which <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. gilvus</i> is the northern representative; which theory is strengthened by the
fact that of the latter there are no specimens found south of the United States, indicating that
in winter it does not pass beyond their limit, or at least not far to the southward.</p>

<abbr title="Review">Rev.</abbr> 1865, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 348. This appears to be merely a permanent
resident race of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solitarius</i>, which itself visits Guatemala only in winter. Closely resembling the
latter, it differs essentially in the respects pointed out above. The difference in coloration is
produced by a shifting, as it were, toward the head of the yellow and olive, leaving the upper
tail-coverts clear ash, and the lower pure white, and encroaching upon the ash anteriorly to the
crown and ear-coverts, and the white alongside of the throat. In the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. plumbeus</i> these tints
are simply almost entirely removed, leaving clear ash and pure white, with a tinge, however, of
olive on the rump and of yellow on the sides. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. cassini</i> the tints are darkened and browned
by the peculiar influence of the region where found, there being neither clear ash, nor olive-green,
nor pure yellow or white, in the plumage.</p>

As this sheet is going through the press, we have been permitted
by Mr. J. A. Allen to examine a series of birds, obtained by him in
July, 1871, on <abbr title="Mount">Mt.</abbr> Lincoln, Colorado, above the timber line, where
they were breeding abundantly. Although very different from winter <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L.

species in summer dress. They present the following characteristics:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="footnote"><i class="subset">Breeding plumage.</i> Differing from the stage first described above, in
entire absence of any ash about the head, and in deep black, instead

peach-blossom pink, that of the abdomen extending farther forward. <abbr title="female symbol">♀</abbr>
lacking the red, or with only a tinge of it. Hood dark vandyke-brown,
becoming nearly black on the forehead; rest of head light
chocolate-brown, similar to, but more faded than, that of the winter
plumage; nasal tufts grayish-white.</p>

pointed out, by which they differ from the winter plumage of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L.
tephrocotis</i>. Taking into consideration the fact of their black
instead of yellowish bill, more intense red, and generally more dusky
colors, as well as the other points of distinction from the previously
known plumages of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. tephrocotis</i>, and also that they are identical
in size and proportion, while specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. tephrocotis</i> in the
breeding plumage have not before been seen, it seems very reasonable
to suppose that these specimens represent the breeding plumage of that
species. There is some resemblance to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. brunneinucha</i>, which, from
the plate in Bonaparte and Schlegel’s monograph of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coccothraustinæ</i>, seems to differ mainly in being lighter colored.
Mr. Allen says that these birds were breeding abundantly in the
locality where they were found.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_115" id="footnote_115"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_115"><span class="muchsmaller">[115]</span></a>
From the fact that this form is not found in any part of Alaska,
nor, indeed, north of California, it is probable that the localities
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anthinus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alaudinus</i> were transposed in Bonaparte’s original
descriptions.</p>

<p class="center">Transcriber’s Note:</p>

<p>The index of English names and index of scientific names appear only
in Volume III; they are reproduced at the end of this book for the
convenience of readers.</p>

<p>Archaic and obsolete spellings were left unchanged, as were variant
spelling of local place names, e.g. Hayti, Alleghany, Wahsatch,
Nenontalik. Also unchanged:</p>

<p class="p0 tnindent">- Lake ‘Winnipeg’ is spelled ‘Winnepeg’ in several locations<br />
  - Repeated number ‘... 39,849 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, 39,849 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, and 39,850 <abbr title="female symbol">♀</abbr>, ...’<br />
  - Figure number is missing in the reference data to Pyranga æstiva, <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> cooperi.<br />
  - ‘mesquite’ is also spelled ‘mezquite’</p>

<p>Footnotes were renumbered sequentially and moved to the end of the
book, preceding the Index to Plates.</p>

<p>In the discussion of the Florida Greenlet, the author used a ‘y’ with
a breve above it to describe the song sound. As this character does
not exist in UTF-8, a macron was used instead of a breve.</p>

<p>Obvious printing errors were corrected, such as duplicate words,
upside down letters, numbers printed backwards, and letters or spacing in the wrong order.</p>

<p>Missing punctuation was added to ends of sentences and abbreviations.
Unprinted letters and numbers were added, where appropriate. A description of
the illustration on the title page was added.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
